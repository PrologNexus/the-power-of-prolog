    <center><h1>Logical Purity</h1></center>
    <br>

    At the heart of each great Prolog program is a property we
    call <b>logical&nbsp;purity</b> or simply <b>purity</b>.
    Informally, this means that the program has the properties we
    expect from a&nbsp;<b>relation</b>.

    <br><br>

    There are two equally justifiable ways to
    characterize purity of Prolog programs:
    <ol>
      <li><i>intrinsic definition</i>, referring to building blocks
        that guarantee purity by construction</li>
      <li><i>extrinsic definition</i>, referring to properties that
        can be tested without knowing details about the code.
      </li>
    </ol>

    In the following, we discuss these variants in more detail and
    give reasons why we care about this property.

    <center><h2>Intrinsic definition</h2></center>

    One way to characterize logical purity is to refer
    to <i>intrinsic</i> properties of a program. In particular, we can
    give an <i>inductive</i> definition of predicates that
    are <i>pure</i>.

    <br><br>

    For example:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>true/0</tt> and <tt>false/0</tt> are pure</li>
      <li><tt>(=)/2</tt> and <tt>dif/2</tt> are pure</li>
      <li><a href="clpfd">arithmetic constraints</a>
      like <tt>(#=)/2</tt> and <tt>(#\=)/2</tt> are pure</li>
      <li><tt><a href="metapredicates#call">call</a>(Goal)</tt> is pure <i>iff</i> <tt>Goal</tt> is pure</li>
      <li><tt><a href="metapredicates#maplist">maplist</a>(Goal, Ls)</tt> is pure <i>iff</i> <tt>Goal</tt> is pure</li>
      <li><tt>(A,B)</tt> and <tt>(A;B)</tt> are pure <i>iff</i> <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are pure</li>
      <li><i>more cases omitted</i></li>
    </ul>

    For a large class of Prolog programs, this approach makes it very
    easy to determine whether a specific program is pure. That is a
    clear advantage of the approach. On the other hand, a drawback of
    this approach is that it does not explain <i>why</i> these
    predicates are pure, and how we can decide which other predicates,
    if any, are also pure.

    <center><h2>Extrinsic definition</h2></center>

    A different approach to characterize logical purity only takes
    into account program properties that can be observed from the
    outside, without knowing any implementation details.

    <br><br>

    For example:

    <ul>
      <li>if a goal produces
        <b>output</b> on the terminal, it is <i>not</i> pure</li>
      <li>if a goal modifies <a href="global"><b>global state</b></a>,
      it is <i>not</i> pure</li>
      <li>if, for a goal <tt>G</tt> that contains the
        subterm&nbsp;<tt>S</tt>, there is a term <tt>T</tt> such
        that <tt>(G,S=T)</tt> <i>succeeds unconditionally</i>,
        but <tt>(S=T,G)</tt> <i>fails</i>, then <tt>G</tt>
        is not&nbsp;<b>monotonic</b> and hence <i>not</i>&nbsp;pure</li>
      <li>analogously: if, for a goal <tt>G</tt> that contains the
        subterm&nbsp;<tt>S</tt>, there is a term&nbsp;<tt>T</tt> such
        that <tt>(G,S=T)</tt> <i>fails</i>,
        but <tt>(S=T,G)</tt> <i>succeeds unconditionally</i>,
        then <tt>G</tt> is <i>not</i>&nbsp;<b>steadfast</b> and
        hence <i>not</i>&nbsp;pure</li>
      <li><i>more cases omitted</i></li>
    </ul>

    An advantage of this approach is that we get a clearer idea about
    the <i>intention</i> behind logical purity. With this term, we
    want to denote programs that satisfy laws and invariants that we
    know from classical first-order logic. Examples of such laws are
    commutativity of conjunction and monotonicity of the consequence
    relation. In addition, we want to rule out programs that leave the
    realm of logic by producing output, deleting files, opening
    sockets&nbsp;etc. A disadvantage of this approach is that we are
    unlikely to come up with an exhaustive list of properties that we
    would like to see preserved. We can certainly cite very prominent
    and important ones though. Primary examples of predicates
    that <i>break</i> these properties in general
    are <tt>!/0</tt>, <tt>(->)/2</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>assertz/1</tt>.

    <center><h2>Practical importance</h2></center>

    When programming in Prolog, retaining logical purity as far as
    possible has immense practical benefits.

    <br><br>

    Here are a few advantages that only apply to logically pure code.

    <br><br>

    <b>Pure code</b>...

    <ul>
      <li>... can be used in <b>all directions</b>, allowing for very
        concise and general specifications that keep our programs
        short. We can try the <a href="concepts#toplevel"><i>most
        general query</i></a> to see what solutions look like.</li>

      <li>... can be <b>changed</b> more flexibly. We can freely
        reorder pure goals and clauses without changing the meaning of
        the program. Reordering goals and clauses can lead to much
        more efficient programs.</li>

      <li>... can be <b>studied</b> more extensively. Reordering goals and
        clauses allows us to study operational effects that in many
        cases cannot even be observed with impure code due to its
        limited generality.</li>
      
      <li>... can be <b>reasoned
        about</b> <i>declaratively</i>. Adding a constraint can at
        most <i>reduce</i> the set of solutions.  Removing a
        constraint can at most <i>extend</i> it. This helps a lot
        when <a href="debugging">debugging</a> unexpected failure
        or success.</li>

      <li>... can be <b>interpreted
          flexibly</b>. We can use depth-first or breadth-first search,
        bottom-up evaluation, iterative deepening or any other strategy
        to derive logical consequences from pure code. As long as
        the inference method is <i>sound</i>, everything that can be derived
        is a semantic consequence of the program. </li>

      <li>... can be <b>tested</b> with built-in features that are
        themselves pure. <a href="testing">Test cases</a> for
        pure code are simply Prolog queries that must fail or succeed,
        depending on the desired outcome. Nothing else is needed. In
        particular, it is not necessary to reason about output that
        only appears on the terminal.</li>

      <li>... is <b>easier to explain</b> and understand than impure
        code. This is because the clauses can be read in isolation,
        and their declarative reading as logical implications is
        admissible. </li>

      <li>... is automatically <b>thread safe</b>: There are
        no <i>destructive</i> modifications in pure&nbsp;code, and
        therefore no data&nbsp;races, where a thread reads data that a
        different thread is modyfing at the same&nbsp;time. This
        property is becoming increasingly important
        for <a href="web">web&nbsp;applications</a>, where a single
        server handles multiple&nbsp;clients in
        different&nbsp;threads.</li>

    </ul>

    Note especially the following: In really interesting applications,
    we do not <i>a&nbsp;priori</i> know the outcome of computations.
    The point of using Prolog in such areas is for example to
    detect <i>whether</i> a specification is ambiguous,
    or <i>whether</i> a specific result arises. Since we do not know
    the outcome before actually running the program, we must not
    impose any restrictions on the formulation such as <i>committing</i>
    to only one of several possibilities. An example of such an
    application is David C.&nbsp;Norris's
    <a href="https://github.com/dcnorris/precautionary"><tt>precautionary</tt></a>
    package for patient-centered safety analysis of phase&nbsp;1
    dose-escalation trials in clinical oncology. Note for example how
    <a href="https://github.com/dcnorris/precautionary/blob/main/exec/prolog/ccd.pl"><tt>cdd.pl</tt></a>
    uses pure constructs as far as possible in order to derive
    interesting statements about the trial&nbsp;specification itself.
    This is an example of an application area where careful
    consideration of all possible outcomes is especially important: If
    the program unexpectedly fails to take into account <i>all</i>
    possibilities that can arise in practice, then the derived results
    are not valid, and medical decisions that are based on these
    results may have disastrous effects. Logical purity ensures that
    <i>all</i> possible cases are considered. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08334"><i>An
    Executable Specification of Oncology Dose-Escalation Protocols
    with Prolog</i></a> for more information.

    <center><h2>Applications to teaching Prolog</h2></center>

    When teaching and learning Prolog, it is very helpful when goals
    and clauses can be freely reordered to study operational effects
    of changes. As already mentioned, this is possible with pure code.
    If you leave the pure monotonic subset of Prolog, phenomena that
    can only be explained procedurally will arise. For example, here
    are a few Prolog queries and a declarative reading of
    corresponding answers:

    <br><br>

    <center>
      <table width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="20%"><b>Query and answer</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
          <td><center><b>Declarative reading</b></center></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"><hr></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>
?- integer(I).
   <b>false.</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i>No integer exists.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>
?- integer(3).
   <b>true.</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i>Yet, 3 is an integer.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>


        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>

   <b>false.</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i>There are no terms for which <tt>X&nbsp;\=&nbsp;Y</tt> holds.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>
?- a \= b.
   <b>true.</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i>In contrast to what the system just said,
            <tt>X&nbsp;\=&nbsp;Y</tt> does hold for example for <tt>X
            = a</tt> and <tt>Y = b</tt>.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>
?- X =:= Y.
   <b>error(...,...).</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i>Insufficient instantiation.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>
?- 3 =:= X,
   X =:= Y.
   <b>error(...,...).</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i>Insufficient instantiation.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>

      </table>
    </center>    

    <br><br>

    It is clear that several properties we expect from pure logic
    programs are violated if we use such legacy predicates. For
    comparison, consider these queries if we use pure
    predicates <i>instead</i>:

    <br><br>

    <center>
      <table width="80%">
        <tr>
          <td width="20%"><b>Query and answer</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

          <td>
            <i>True iff <tt>I</tt> is an integer.</i>

        </tr>

        <tr>

            <div class="query">

          </td>
          <td>
            <i>In particular, 3 is an integer.</i>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="query">
              <pre>

   <b>dif:dif(X, Y).</b>

          <td>
            <i>The query holds <i>iff</i> <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt>

        </tr>

        <tr>

            <div class="query">
              <pre>

   <b>true.</b>
              </pre>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td>
            <i> In particular, <tt>dif(X, Y)</tt> holds for example for <tt>X

          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>

          </td>
        </tr>

      </table>
    </center>    

    From such examples, we see that using pure predicates allows us to
    teach and reason about important and desirable properties of logic
    programs in a uniform and logical&nbsp;way.

    <center><h2>How far can we take this?</h2></center>

    To what extent and how can we solve the tasks we want to express
    with pure code <i>exclusively</i>, making the code as elegant and
    general as possible while retaining acceptable performance? This
    is an open <b>research&nbsp;question</b>, arguably the most
    important question in declarative language research.

    <br><br>

    It is sometimes argued that impure language constructs are
    <i>necessary</i> to obtain acceptable performance. There is no
    evidence for this. In fact, there is some indication that supports
    the opposite conclusion: Many important optimizations may
    realistically be applicable <i>only&nbsp;if</i> sufficiently large
    program fragments are kept pure. For example, the declarative
    language <a href="https://mercurylang.org/"><b>Mercury</b></a>
    totally omits many impure constructs that are sometimes used in
    Prolog, yet still remains practical <i>and</i> much more efficient
    than almost all Prolog
    implementations. <a href="https://www.haskell.org/"><b>Haskell</b></a>
    is another example of a programming language that allows
    aggressive <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Performance">compiler&nbsp;optimizations</a> <i>due&nbsp;to</i>
    its purity.

    <br><br>

    Recent developments in many Prolog implementations are designed to
    let us describe ever larger subsets of our programs by pure
    methods. In modern Prolog systems, even reading from files can be
    described in a pure way under quite general assumptions. See Ulrich
    Neumerkel's <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/swi/pio.pl"><b>library(pio)</b></a>
    for more information.

    <br><br>

    An important recent publication showing how to preserve logical
    purity while retaining acceptable performance in many situations
    of high practical relevance
    is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01590"><b><i>Indexing
          dif/2</i></b></a> by Ulrich&nbsp;Neumerkel and Stefan&nbsp;Kral.
