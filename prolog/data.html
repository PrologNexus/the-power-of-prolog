    <center><h1>Prolog Data Structures</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    <center><h2 id="term">Terms</h2></center>

    In Prolog, all data are represented by Prolog <b>terms</b>.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/terms"><img src="videos/t_terms.png" alt="Terms"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    Each term is either a <b>variable</b>, an <b>atomic term</b> or
    a <b>compound&nbsp;term</b>:

    <ul>
      <li><b>variables</b> start with an uppercase letter or with an
        underscore&nbsp;(<tt>_</tt>). A single underscore denotes
        an <i>anonymous&nbsp;variable</i> and can be read as
        "any&nbsp;term". For example, <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, <tt>_çˆ±</tt> and <tt>Prolog</tt> are variables.

      <li><b>atomic terms</b> are:
        <ul>
          <li><b>atoms</b>, such as <tt>x</tt>, <tt>test</tt>
              and <tt>'quotes and space'</tt>
          </li>
          <li><b>integers</b>, such as <tt>42</tt></li>
          <li>floating point numbers</li>
          <li>depending on the Prolog&nbsp;system, there are also
            other kinds of atomic terms, such as complex&nbsp;numbers
            and rational&nbsp;numbers.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><b>compound terms</b> are defined inductively as
        follows: <i>If</i> <tt>T<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>T<sub>2</sub></tt>,
        ..., <tt>T<sub>N</sub></tt> are
        terms, <i>then</i> <i>F</i>(<tt>T<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>T<sub>2</sub></tt>,
        ..., <tt>T<sub>N</sub></tt>) is also a term, where <i>F</i> is
        called a <i>functor&nbsp;name</i> and adheres to the same
        syntax rules as&nbsp;atoms. <i>F/N</i> is called
        the <i>principal&nbsp;functor</i> of the compound term,
        and <tt>N</tt> is called the <i>arity</i>.
        Examples: <tt>f(a)</tt>, <tt>g(f(X))</tt> and <tt>+(a,
        f(X))</tt>.</li>
    </ul>

    All data can be represented in this way. Terms come into existence
    by simply writing them&nbsp;down.

    <br><br>

    A term is called <i>ground</i> if it contains no variables. A
    compound&nbsp;term is called <i>partially&nbsp;instantiated</i> if
    one of its subterms is a variable.

    <br><br>

    Prolog is <i>dynamically typed</i> and allows us great freedom for
    representing data. For example, we <i>could</i> represent natural
    numbers as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>we <i>could</i> use the atom <tt>zero</tt> to represent&nbsp;0</li>
      <li>we <i>could</i> use the compound term <tt>s(X)</tt> to
        represent the successor of&nbsp;<tt>X</tt>.</li>
    </ul>

    In this representation, the term <tt>s(s(s(zero)))</tt> represents
    the number&nbsp;3. Such a representation is of course highly
    impractical due to its enormous size for large&nbsp;numbers. For
    this reason, Prolog provides <a href="clpz">integer
      arithmetic</a> with a much more efficient number representation.

    <br><br>

    Prolog terms naturally correspond
    to&nbsp;<a href="optimization#tree">trees</a>. There is a
    <a href="sorting#order">standard&nbsp;order</a> on&nbsp;terms.

    <br><br>

    You can define custom prefix-, infix- and postfix <b>operators</b>
    that let you write terms in different ways.

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/operators"><img src="videos/t_operators.png" alt="Operators"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br><br>

    Several standard
    operators are predefined. For example, you can write <tt>a+b</tt>
    and <tt>X=Y</tt> instead of <tt>+(a,b)</tt> and <tt>=(X,Y)</tt>,
    respectively.



    <center><h2 id="list">Lists</h2></center>

    Prolog <b>lists</b> are a special case of <a href="#term"><i>terms</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/lists"><img src="videos/t_lists.png" alt="Lists"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    <br><br>
    Lists are defined inductively:

    <ul>
      <li>the atom <tt>[]</tt> is a list, denoting the <i>empty list</i></li>
      <li><i>if</i> <tt>Ls</tt> is a list, <i>then</i> the term <tt>'.'(L,
          Ls)</tt> is <i>also</i> a list.</li>
    </ul>

    There is a special syntax for denoting lists conveniently in Prolog:

    <ol>
      <li>The list <tt>'.'(a, '.'(b, '.'(c, [])))</tt> can also be
        written as <tt>[a,b,c]</tt>.</li>

      <li>The term <tt>'.'(L, Ls)</tt> can also be written as <tt>[L|Ls]</tt>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    These notations can be combined in any way. For example, the term
    <tt>[a,b|Ls]</tt> is a list <i>iff</i> <tt>Ls</tt> is a list.

    <br><br>

    Lists naturally represent <i>collections</i> of elements and arise
    in almost all Prolog&nbsp;programs. When choosing between lists
    and any other way to represent collections of elements, ask
    yourself the following questions:

    <ul>
      <li>Can there be <i>arbitrarily many</i> elements?</li>
      <li>Can there be <i>zero</i> elements?</li>
      <li>Is the <i>order</i> of elements significant?</li>
      <li>Are the elements of the same <i>kind</i>?</li>
    </ul>

    If your answer is "yes" to most of these questions, lists are
    often a good&nbsp;fit.

    <br><br>

    In contrast, consider for example the case where each collection
    comprises exactly three elements. You can use lists of the
    form <tt>[A,B,C]</tt> to represent such collections, and thus
    benefit from <a href="metapredicates">meta-predicates</a> that
    reason over&nbsp;lists. On the other hand, using compound terms of
    the form <tt>f(A,B,C)</tt> is more memory efficient: This is
    because the list <tt>[A,B,C]</tt> is the compound
    term <tt>'.'(A,'.'(B,'.'(C,[])))</tt> and thus takes
    roughly <i>twice</i> the space of the term <tt>f(A,B,C)</tt>
    in&nbsp;memory.

    <br><br>

    <a href="dcg">DCG notation</a> is frequently used for
    describing&nbsp;lists.

    <center><h2 id="pair">Pairs</h2></center>

    <i>Pairs</i> are terms with principal functor <tt>(-)/2</tt>. For
    example, the term <tt>-(A, B)</tt> denotes the pair of
    elements <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>. In Prolog, <tt>(-)/2</tt> is
    defined as an infix <i>operator</i>. Therefore, the term can be
    written equivalently as&nbsp;<tt>A-B</tt>.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/pairs"><img src="videos/t_pairs.png" alt="Pairs"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    The standard
    predicate <a href="sorting#keysort"><tt>keysort/2</tt></a> is an
    example of a predicate that reasons about pairs. They are
    called <i>Key-Value</i> pairs because the first argument of each
    pair is used as the <i>key</i> for sorting. Many Prolog systems
    provide additional predicates for reasoning about pairs, and they
    often adopt this terminology from <tt>keysort/2</tt>. Common
    examples of such predicates are
    <tt>pairs_keys_values/3</tt> and <tt>pairs_keys/2</tt> to relate a
    list of pairs to their respective keys and values.

    <center><h2 id="assoc">Association lists</h2></center>

    In many Prolog systems, <b>association lists</b> are available to
    allow faster than linear access to a collection of elements. These
    association lists are typically based on balanced trees
    like <b>AVL</b>&nbsp;trees.

    <br><br>

    There is a public domain library called <tt>library(assoc)</tt>
    that ships with many Prolog systems and provides operations for
    inserting, fetching and changing elements of a collection.

    <br><br>

    Here is one way to represent an AVL&nbsp;tree in Prolog:

    <ol>
      <li>the <i>empty</i> tree is represented by the
        atom&nbsp;<tt>t</tt>.</li>
      <li>an <i>inner&nbsp;node</i> is represented as
        a <i>compound&nbsp;term</i> of the form <tt>t(Key, Value,
          Balance, Left, Right)</tt> where:

        <ul>
          <li><tt>Key</tt> and <tt>Value</tt> represent
            the <i>association</i> of&nbsp;<tt>Key</tt>
            with&nbsp;<tt>Value</tt>.</li>
          <li><tt>Balance</tt> is an <i>atom</i> that denotes a
          balance criterion, such as a relation between the number of
          children of the left and right subtrees. For example, we can
          use the atoms <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>=</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> to
            denote different states between the subtrees.
          </li>

          <li><tt>Left</tt> and <tt>Right</tt> are AVL&nbsp;trees.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    Every operation on AVL&nbsp;trees, such as adding or changing an
    association, can be described as a <i>relation</i> between
    different trees, one tree <i>before</i> the operation and
    one <i>after</i>&nbsp;it. See <a href="/tist/"><i>Thinking
        in&nbsp;States</i></a> for more information.

    <br><br>

    AVL&nbsp;trees let us perform many important operations
    in <i>O</i>(log(<i>N</i>))&nbsp;time, where <i>N</i> is the number
    of associations. This is acceptably efficient in many&nbsp;cases.


    <center><h2 id="string">Strings?</h2></center>

    Almost everything that needs to be said about <i>strings</i> has
    been brilliantly said by Richard O'Keefe in
    his <a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/pllib.htm">Prolog
    Library Proposal</a>. In particular, <b>strings
    are&nbsp;wrong</b>, and:

    <blockquote>
      For almost any use case that involves some kind of processing,
      the only sensible thing to do with string data is to turn it
      into some kind of tree <i>early</i>. Prolog is brilliant with
      trees.
    </blockquote>

    In Prolog, a convenient and natural representation of strings is
    to use lists of <i>characters</i>, which are
    one-character <i>atoms</i>. If you set the Prolog
    flag <tt>double_quotes</tt> to&nbsp;<tt>chars</tt>, then
    double-quoted strings are automatically interpreted as lists of
    characters. To enable this setting, add the following directive at
    the start of your Prolog programs, or to your Prolog system's
    configuration&nbsp;file:
    <br><br>
    <pre class="box">
<b>:- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).</b></pre>

    <br><br>
    With this setting, we obtain for example:

    <pre>
<b>?- "abc" = [a,b,c].</b>
   true.
    </pre>

    Thus, working with strings is reduced to working
    with&nbsp;<a href="#list">lists</a>, which can be easily handled
    in&nbsp;Prolog and are amenable to built-in mechanisms such
    as&nbsp;<a href="dcg">DCGs</a>.

    <br><br>

    Treating strings as lists of characters has a long tradition in
    Prolog systems, starting with the very first Prolog system,
    Marseille&nbsp;Prolog. Some Prolog systems opted to represent
    strings as lists of character&nbsp;<i>codes</i>, i.e., as lists
    of <i>integers</i> instead&nbsp;of lists of atoms, and these
    integers represent code&nbsp;points that depend on the used
    encoding. This behaviour is available if you set the Prolog
    flag <tt>double_quotes</tt> to <tt>codes</tt>. This is not
    recommended though, because it renders answers much less readable
    than using <tt>chars</tt>. Alternatively, you can also set the
    flag to <tt>atom</tt>, which makes Prolog treat double-quoted
    strings as
    <i>atoms</i>. The main drawback of using the value <tt>atom</tt>
    is that atoms preclude the use of DCGs and other predicates that
    reason about lists and partial&nbsp;lists. In addition, since
    atoms cannot be <i>partially</i> instantiated, your code will
    become <i>moded</i>: This means that it can only be used in a
    proper subset of all conceivable directions.

    <br><br>

    For these reasons, <tt>chars</tt> is the recommended setting, and
    newer Prolog systems such as Tau&nbsp;Prolog and Scryer&nbsp;Prolog
    already use this value by default.

    <br><br>

    With a suitable implementation technique, Prolog&nbsp;systems can
    represent lists of characters very efficiently, making them both
    convenient and fast to work with.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/representing_strings"><img src="videos/t_representing_strings.png" alt="Representing Strings"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    There is thus hope that more Prolog systems will
    use <tt>chars</tt> as the default value in the future.

    <center><h2>Arrays?</h2></center>

    What about <b>arrays</b>? Is there any data structure in Prolog to
    represent a collection of terms, allowing
    for <i>O(1)</i>&nbsp;access to individual elements?

    <br><br>

    First of all, the concept of <i>destructive</i> modifications is
    alien to logic programming. In Prolog, we
    describe <i>relations</i> between entities, not destructive
    effects. To express a change in a Prolog data structure, we define
    a predicate that relates the state of the structure <i>before</i>
    the change to a different structure <i>after</i> the change. For
    this reason, <a href="purity"><b>pure</b></a> modifications
    often entail some <i>copying</i> of data and typically lead to at
    least logarithmic overhead (for example, to copy a subtree of a
    balanced tree).

    <br><br>

    That being said, we can access the <i>arguments</i> of a term
    in <i>O(1)</i> with the built-in predicate <tt>arg/3</tt>. There
    even is an impure predicate called <tt>setarg/3</tt> which allows
    destructive modifications to a term. Use it at your own peril: If
    you use <tt>setarg/3</tt>, you can no longer reason about your
    code in the way you expect from pure relations. If you really need
    efficient destructive modifications of terms, it is better to
    use <a href="attributedvariables">attributed&nbsp;variables</a>.


    <h2 id="type_tests">Type tests</h2>

    There are predicates to test for specific <i>types</i>
    of&nbsp;terms.

    <br><br>

    Unfortunately, the standard predicates for type testing
    (<tt>atom/1</tt>, <tt>integer/1</tt>, <tt>compound/1</tt> etc.)
    are <i>logically flawed</i> because they are not monotonic: If you
    use these predicates, then <i>generalizing</i> a query may lead
    to <i>fewer</i> solutions,
    preventing <a href="debugging">declarative&nbsp;debugging</a>
    based on logical properties. For example, <tt>atom/1</tt> fails
    for the most general query, even though it succeeds for
    more&nbsp;specific queries:

    <pre>
?-        atom(X).
<b>false.</b>

?- X = a, atom(X).
<b>X = a.</b>
    </pre>

    Therefore, new families of predicates for type testing are now
    becoming available. They implement type&nbsp;tests with desirable
    logical properties:

    <ul>
      <li>the <tt>..._si/1</tt> family of predicates which are like
        the standard predicates if the arguments
        are <i>sufficiently&nbsp;instantiated</i></li>
      <li><tt>must_be/2</tt>, used for <i>input</i> arguments</li>
      <li><tt>can_be/2</tt>, used for <i>output</i> arguments and general arguments.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/type_tests"><img src="videos/t_type_tests.png" alt="Type tests"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    The predicates <tt>must_be/2</tt> and <tt>can_be/2</tt> are
    especially useful for Prolog library
    authors. The <tt>..._si/1</tt> family of type tests are useful in
    normal Prolog programs, if you want to explicitly test for
    specific types without raising <i>type&nbsp;errors</i>.

    <br><br>

    Importantly, all these predicates
    raise <a href="engineering#errors"><i>instantiation&nbsp;errors</i></a>
    if the terms that are tested are not sufficiently instantianted to
    allow a sound&nbsp;decision.

    <center><h2 id="clean">Clean vs. defaulty representations</h2></center>

    When representing data with Prolog terms, ask yourself the following question:

    <blockquote>
      Can I <i>distinguish the kind</i> of each component from
      its <i>principal functor</i>?
    </blockquote>

    If this holds, your representation is called <b>clean</b>. If
    you <i>cannot</i> distinguish the elements by their principal
    functor, your representation is called&nbsp;<b>defaulty</b>, a
    wordplay combining "default" and&nbsp;"faulty". This is
    because <i>reasoning</i> about your data will need a
    "<i>default&nbsp;case</i>", which is applied if everything else
    fails. In addition, such a representation prevents argument
    indexing, and is considered
    <i>faulty</i> due to this shortcoming. Always aim to <i>avoid</i>
    defaulty representations! Aim for cleaner representations instead.


    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/clean_vs_defaulty"><img src="videos/t_clean_vs_defaulty.png" alt="Clean vs. Defaulty Representations"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    For example, suppose you represent a <b>full binary tree</b> in
    Prolog. There are two <i>kinds</i> of elements in a full binary
    tree:

    <ul>
      <li><b>leaves</b>, which are concrete elements of the tree</li>
      <li><b>nodes</b>, which have two children that are again full
      binary trees.</li>
    </ul>

    We can represent such trees with Prolog terms as follows:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>leaf(L)</tt> represents the <i>leaf</i> <tt>L</tt></li>
      <li><tt>node(Left, Right)</tt> represents a <i>node</i> and its
        two&nbsp;children.</li>
    </ul>

    The above is a <b>clean</b> representation: It lets us distinguish
    the kinds of elements by their principal functor. We can reason
    about such trees in a way that keeps the code very general and
    usable in all directions. Such a representation is also amenable
    to <a href="efficiency#indexing">argument&nbsp;indexing</a>.

    <br><br>

    You can also recognize a clean representation if it lets you
    describe the general <i>structure</i> of your data while retaining
    enough flexibility to keep the concrete elements unspecified. For
    example, in the case of full binary trees, we can represent the
    general outline of all trees with exactly <i>two leaves</i>
    as <tt>node(leaf(_),leaf(_))</tt>. If you had chosen
    to <i>omit</i> the <tt>leaf/1</tt> wrapper for representing
    leaves, this would become <tt>node(_,_)</tt>: a <i>defaulty</i>
    representation that no longer represents precisely such
    manifestations.

    <br><br>

    Sometimes, it will appear to you that there is no clean way out.
    For instance, you may be faced with a representation
    that <i>requires</i> you to distinguish different cases in an
    impure and non-monotonic way, such as by testing
    the <i>instantiation</i> of certain arguments
    via&nbsp;<tt>var/1</tt>. In such cases, it is good practice to
    restrict the impure parts of your program to small fragments, and
    to <i>convert</i> any defaulty representation to a clean&nbsp;one
    by introducing suitable wrappers that let you distinguish the
    cases by pattern&nbsp;matching. This helps to ensure that you can
    use your core predicates in multiple directions.

    <center><h2>Term inspection</h2></center>

    In Prolog, the most natural way to reason about&nbsp;terms is to
    rely on <i>unification</i>. In addition, there are several
    predicates that let you decompose and analyze&nbsp;terms. The most
    important of these <b>term&nbsp;inspection</b> predicates
    are <tt>functor/3</tt>, <tt>arg/3</tt> and <tt>(=..)/2</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Here are examples that illustrate their usage:

    <pre>
<b>?- functor(f(a,g(X)), Functor, Arity).</b>
Functor = f,
Arity = 2.

<b>?- functor(Term, f, 2).</b>
Term = f(_25002, _25004).

<b>?- arg(2, f(a,g(X)), Arg).</b>
Arg = g(X).

<b>?- f(a,g(X)) =.. [Functor|Args].</b>
Functor = f,
Args = [a, g(X)].

<b>?- Term =.. [f,a,g(X)].</b>
Term = f(a, g(X)).
    </pre>

    These predicates cannot be defined by a finite set of clauses, and
    can therefore be considered <a href="metapredicates">higher-order
    predicates</a>. Do not get carried away with these predicates!
    Everything that <i>can</i> be expressed by
    pattern&nbsp;matching <i>should</i> be expressed by
    pattern&nbsp;matching. For example, instead of <tt>functor(Term,
    f, 2)</tt>, you can simply write <tt>Term = f(_,_)</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Every Prolog term has a <b>canonical</b> representation. If you
    are ever unsure about the structure of a&nbsp;term,
    use <tt>write_canonical/1</tt> to obtain the canonical
    representation. For example:

    <pre>
?- write_canonical(a+b=[x,y,z]).
<b>=(+(a,b),'.'(x,'.'(y,'.'(z,[]))))</b>
    </pre>

    The canonical representation shows the structure of the&nbsp;term
    in such a way that it can also be easily parsed by
    external&nbsp;programs.
