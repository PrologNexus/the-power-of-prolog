    <center><h2>Why are you here?</h2></center>

    As a Prolog programmer, you likely have a rebellious streak
    in&nbsp;you. In many cases, this is what it takes to guide you
    away from how an entire industry currently tries to solve
    problems. To focus on what lies&nbsp;<i>beyond</i>.

    <br><br>

    The point of this page is to show you where following this streak
    is likely <i>not</i> a good&nbsp;idea because the cost
    is&nbsp;high, and there is no benefit to&nbsp;it.

    <br><br>

    A small number of rules suffices to write great
    Prolog&nbsp;code. Breaking them will result in programs that are
    defective in one or more&nbsp;ways.


    <center><h2>The horror: Losing solutions</h2></center>

    A Prolog program that <i>terminates</i> and is acceptably
    efficient can be <i>defective</i> in two major ways:

    <ol>
      <li>It reports <i>wrong</i> answers.</li>
      <li>It <i>fails to report</i> intended solutions.</li>
    </ol>

    Which of these cases is worse? Think about this!

    <br><br>

    Suppose a program is defective <i>only</i> in the first way. Is
    there anything you can do to still obtain only correct results?
    Then, suppose a program is defective <i>only</i> in the second
    way. What are your options to somehow still obtain all solutions
    that were intended?

    <br><br>

    The primary means to make your programs defective in
    the <i>second</i> way is to use <i>impure</i>
    and <i>non-monotonic</i> language constructs. Examples of this
    are <tt>!/0</tt>, if-then-else and&nbsp;<tt>var/1</tt>. A
    declarative way out is to use <a href="data#clean">clean</a>
    data&nbsp;structures, <i>constraints</i>
    like <a href="concepts#builtins"><tt>dif/2</tt></a>, and
    meta-predicates
    like&nbsp;<a href="metapredicates#if_3"><b><tt>if_/3</tt></b></a>.

    <center><h2>The horror: Global state</h2></center>

    As a beginner, you will be tempted to modify
    the <a href="global">global&nbsp;database</a> in Prolog. This
    introduces <i>implicit&nbsp;dependencies</i> within your programs.
    By "implicit", I mean that there is nothing in your program
    that <i>enforces</i> these dependencies. For example, if you use
    such predicates in a different order than intended, they may
    unexpectedly fail or yield strange results.

    <br><br>

    The primary means to make your programs defective in this way is
    to use predicates like <tt>assertz/1</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>retract/1</tt>. A declarative way out is to use
    predicate <i>arguments</i>
    or <a href="dcg#semicontext">semicontext&nbsp;notation</a> to
    thread the state&nbsp;through.

    <center><h2>The horror: Impure output</h2></center>

    As a beginner, you will sometimes be tempted to <i>print</i>
    answers on the system terminal instead of letting the toplevel
    report&nbsp;them. For example, your programs may contain code
    like&nbsp;this:

    <pre>
solve :-
        solution(S),
        format("the solution is: ~q\n", [S]).
    </pre>

    A major drawback of this approach is that <i>you cannot easily
    reason about such output</i>, since it only occurs on the system
    terminal and is not available as a Prolog&nbsp;term within your
    program. Therefore, you will not write test cases for such output,
    increasing the likelihood of introducing changes that break such
    predicates. Another severe shortcoming is that this prevents you
    to use the code as a true <i>relation</i>.

    <br><br>

    To benefit from the full generality of relations, <i>describe</i>
    a solution with Prolog&nbsp;code, and <i>let the toplevel do the
    printing</i>:

    <pre>
solution(S) :-
        constraint_1(S),
        etc.
    </pre>


    Sometimes, you may want special formatting. In such case, you can
    still describe the output in a pure way, using for example the
    nonterminal&nbsp;<a href="dcg#output"><tt><b>format_//2</b></tt></a>.
    This makes test&nbsp;cases easy to&nbsp;write.

    <center><h2>The horror: Low-level language constructs</h2></center>

    Some Prolog programmers may see little reason to use more recent
    language constructs. For example, CLP(FD) constraints have only
    been widely available for about 20&nbsp;years, which is
    a <i>comparatively</i> recent development for&nbsp;Prolog. If you
    think that low-level constructs have served you well, why bother
    learning newer material? The fact that millions of students
    were <i>not</i> well served by lower-level constructs need not
    concern&nbsp;you.

    <br><br>

    Unfortunately, sticking to low-level constructs comes at a high
    price: It makes the language harder to teach, harder to learn and
    harder to understand than necessary. It requires students to learn
    declarative and operational semantics essentially <i>at the same
      time</i>, which is too&nbsp;much at once in almost all&nbsp;cases.

    <br><br>

    The primary means to make Prolog harder to teach than necessary is
    to introduce beginners to low-level predicates for arithmetic
    like <tt>(is)/2</tt>, <tt>(=:=)/2</tt> and <tt>(&gt;)/2</tt>. A
    declarative way out is to <i>teach constraints
    instead</i>. See <a href="clpfd"><b>declarative integer
        arithmetic</b></a>.

    <center><h2>Horror factorial</h2></center>

    To see some of these defects exemplified, behold the <i><b>horror
    factorial</b></i>:

    <pre>
horror_factorial(0, 1) :- !.
horror_factorial(N, F) :-
        N &gt; 0,
        N1 is N - 1,
        horror_factorial(N1, F1),
        F is N*F1.
    </pre>

    Observe the horror of <i>losing solutions</i> when posting
    the <a href="concepts#toplevel">most general query</a>:

    <pre>
?- horror_factorial(N, F).
<b>   N = 0, F = 1.</b>
    </pre>

    The version without <tt>!/0</tt> is almost as horrendous:

    <pre>
horror_factorial(0, 1).
horror_factorial(N, F) :-
        N &gt; 0,
        N1 is N - 1,
        horror_factorial(N1, F1),
        F is N*F1.
    </pre>

    The horror of low-level language constructs prevails:

    <pre>
?- horror_factorial(N, F).
   N = 0, F = 1
;  <b>caught: error(instantiation_error,'(is)'/2)</b>
    </pre>

    If you accept this, you are

    <ul>
      <li>limited by using outdated language constructs.</li>
      <li>mistaking relations for functions.</li>
      <li>not caring about the most general query.</li>
      <li>preventing <a href="debugging">declarative debugging</a> by using impure constructs.</li>
    </ul>

    <center><h2>A way out: Purity</h2></center>

    To stop the horror, stay in the <a href="purity">pure</a>
    monotonic subset of Prolog.

    <br><br>

    Start small. For example, instead of low-level integer arithmetic,
    use a more declarative alternative:

    <pre>
horror_factorial(0, 1) :- !.
horror_factorial(N, F) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        N1 #= N - 1,
        horror_factorial(N1, F1),
        F #= N*F1.
    </pre>

    Still better than nothing. Then, remove the <tt>!/0</tt>:

    <pre>
n_factorial(0, 1).
n_factorial(N, F) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        N1 #= N - 1,
        n_factorial(N1, F1),
        F #= N*F1.
    </pre>

    This version also works for the <i>most general</i> query:

    <pre>
?- n_factorial(N, F).
<b>   N = 0, F = 1
;  N = 1, F = 1
;  N = 2, F = 2
;  N = 3, F = 6
;  ...</b>
    </pre>

    That's quite good: A few simple changes have led to a quite
    general logic program.

    <center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>

    In summary, I recommend you <i>rebel where it makes sense</i>,
    and <i>only</i> there.

    <br><br>

    It is ill-directed rebellion to cling to outdated features, for
    life is not lived backwards nor tarries in yesterday.

    <br><br>

    Use declarative constructs in your Prolog programs to make them
    more general while retaining acceptable performance.
