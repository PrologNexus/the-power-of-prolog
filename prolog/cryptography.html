    <center><h1>Cryptography with Prolog</h1></center>
    <br><br>


    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

    Prolog has several features that make it extremely well-suited
    for <b>cryptographic</b> applications.  For example,
    built-in <a href="clpfd">integer&nbsp;arithmetic</a> that works
    for arbitrarily large numbers makes it easy to reason about large
    prime&nbsp;numbers and various operations on them that frequently
    arise in the context of cryptography. As another example, Prolog's
    built-in&nbsp;<a href="sorting#searching">search&nbsp;mechanism</a>
    lets you easily experiment with brute-force attacks such as
    exhaustive search for&nbsp;keys, which has great didactic
    value. The Prolog&nbsp;<a href="concepts#toplevel">toplevel</a>
    lets us interactively try various predicates and their
    parameters. And so&nbsp;on.

    <br><br>

    Support for cryptographic algorithms varies between
    Prolog&nbsp;systems. In the following, we are using Scryer Prolog due
    to its
    <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/crypto.pl"><tt>library(crypto)</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    In this text, we consider three aspects of cryptography that are
    extremely relevant in practice:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#hash"><b>hash&nbsp;functions</b></a> that let us assess the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of data</li>
      <li><a href="#signatures"><b>digital&nbsp;signatures</b></a> to declare and assess the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">authenticity</a> of data</li>
      <li><a href="#symmetric-encryption"><b>symmetric encryption</b></a> to ensure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality">confidentiality</a> of data.</li>
    </ul>

    We shall focus on the <i>practical</i> application of these
    methods, with sample code that you can try out and&nbsp;use.  The
    methods I use in this document are all deemed at
    least <i>reasonably&nbsp;secure</i>
    in December&nbsp;2021. <b>Beware</b>&nbsp;though: Make sure to follow best
    current practices when you use these methods in your own
    applications. This includes studying additional reference material
    and at least an introductory textbook on this subject. For
    example, consider
    reading <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Modern-Cryptography-Second-Edition/Katz-Lindell/p/book/9781466570269"><i>Introduction
    to Modern Cryptography</i></a> by Jonathan&nbsp;Katz and
    Yehuda&nbsp;Lindell, and the references included&nbsp;therein.

    <br><br>

    The convention I use in this document is that information that
    ought to be kept <span class="secret"><i>secret</i></span> is
    written in&nbsp;<span class="secret">red</span>.

    <center><h2>Data representation: characters, codes, bytes etc.</h2></center>

    In Prolog, <i>lists of characters</i> are the preferred
    representation of text and also of binary data. The reason is that
    lists of characters can be represented very efficiently, and are
    amenable to reasoning with DCGs and built-in predicates for lists.
    Also, processing lists of characters leaves little trace in a
    system's <i>atom&nbsp;table</i>. These properties make lists of
    characters an ideal representation in cryptographic applications.

    <br><br>

    A character is an <i>atom</i> of length 1. A list of characters is
    also called a <i>string</i>. Each character has a
    corresponding <i>code</i>, which is an integer. The standard
    predicate <tt>char_code/2</tt> relates a character to its code.

    <br><br>

    In the following, we assume that the Prolog
    flag <tt>double_quotes</tt> is set to <tt>chars</tt>, which is the
    default and recommended setting in Scryer Prolog. It lets us write
    a string very compactly if we enclose it in double&nbsp;quotes.
    For example, the string <tt>[a,b,c]</tt> can be written more
    compactly as&nbsp;<tt>"abc"</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Hexadecimal escape sequences can be used in strings to embed any
    character by its code. For example, the
    string <tt>"\x0\\x12\\x2124\"</tt> is the same term as the
    list <tt>['\x0\','\x12\','\x2124\']</tt>, namely a list with three
    characters with respective codes 0, 18 and&nbsp;8484.

    <br><br>

    Cryptographic methods typically work on&nbsp;<i>bytes</i>, and
    code points that are greater than&nbsp;255 do not fit into a
    single&nbsp;byte. Therefore, many predicates
    in <tt>library(crypto)</tt> provide two different ways to reason
    about strings, specified via the <tt>encoding/1</tt> option:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>encoding(<b>utf8</b>)</tt> uses the UTF-8 encoding of
        the string as the sequence of bytes. This is the default.
      </li>

      <li><tt>encoding(<b>octet</b>)</tt> works on the sequence of
        bytes that is specified by the <i>code</i> of each character in
        the list. Of course, this only works if all occurring characters
        have codes in the range&nbsp;0..255.
      </li>
    </ul>

    If the <tt>encoding(octet)</tt> option is used, then you may (as
    an alternative to a list of characters) also specify a list
    of <i>bytes</i> as the input, i.e., integers in the
    range&nbsp;0..255.

    <br><br>

    There are conversion predicates that let us transform every Prolog
    term into a list of characters or bytes that can be processed
    with <tt>library(crypto)</tt>. For example, the standard
    predicate <tt>atom_chars/2</tt> relates an atom to a list of
    characters, and the predicate <tt>chars_utf8bytes/2</tt>
    from <tt>library(charsio)</tt> relates a list of characters to its
    UTF-8 encoding, specified as a list of bytes:

    <pre>
?- atom_chars(<b>'κρυπτός'</b>, Cs).
<b>   Cs = "κρυπτός".</b>

?- chars_utf8bytes("κρυπτός", UTF8).
<b>   UTF8 = [206,186,207,129,207,133,207,128,207,132|...]</b>.
    </pre>

    In cryptographic applications, short lists of <i>bytes</i> also
    often need to be communicated to other programs and participants,
    and in these use cases it is common to represent such lists
    in <i>hexadecimal</i> notation. This means that each byte is
    represented by exactly two hexadecimal&nbsp;digits
    (between <tt>0</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>F</tt>) that are then stringed
    together. We can use <tt><b>hex_bytes/2</b></tt> to easily
    convert between these encodings:

    <pre>
?- hex_bytes(<b>"501ACE"</b>, Bs).
   Bs = [80,26,206].

?- hex_bytes(Hex, <b>[80,26,206]</b>).
   Hex = "501ace".
    </pre>

    To create a list of <i>cryptographically strong</i> pseudo-random
    bytes, we can
    use <tt><b>crypto_n_random_bytes/2</b></tt>. For
    example, here is a 256-bit (i.e., 32&nbsp;bytes) sequence that in all
    likelihood nobody else has ever generated before&nbsp;me:

    <pre>
?- crypto_n_random_bytes(32, Bs),
   hex_bytes(Key, Bs).
   Bs = [135,227,97,217,131,152,108,154,145,104|...],
   Key = <b>"87e361d983986c9a91686ef90ccdedc22b852370612543ab99563ba92bd902b5"</b>
    </pre>

    Thus, we can easily generate strong keys and unique tokens when needed.

    <br><br>

    To more compactly store and embed binary data in your
    applications, also consider Base64&nbsp;encoding.

    <center><h2 id="hash">Cryptographic hash functions</h2></center>

    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic
      hash function</a> lets us efficiently map data
      of <i>arbitrary</i> size to a bit&nbsp;string of <i>fixed</i>
      size in such a way that the mapping is infeasible to invert and
      collisions are very&nbsp;unlikely.

    <br><br>

    Hash functions are needed in almost all applications of modern
    cryptography. In <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/crypto.pl"><tt>library(crypto)</tt></a>,
    among the most important predicates for computing cryptographic
    hashes
    is <tt>crypto_data_hash/3</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Here is an example (click on the hash to expand it):

    <pre>
?- crypto_data_hash("Hello world!", Hash, [algorithm(blake2s256)]).
<b>   Hash = "<span class="hex">c63813a8f804abece06213a46acd04a2d738c8e7a58fbf94bfe066a9c7f89197</span>".</b>
    </pre>

    We can use <tt>hex_bytes/2</tt> to convert such hex-encoded values
    to lists of&nbsp;<i>bytes</i>, by which we mean lists of integers
    between 0&nbsp;and&nbsp;255. For example:

    <pre>
?- hex_bytes("<span class="hex">c63813a8f804abece06213a46acd04a2d738c8e7a58fbf94bfe066a9c7f89197</span>", Bytes).
<b>   Bytes = [198,56,19,168,248,4,171,236,224,98|...]</b>.
    </pre>

    <i>Security of default algorithms</i> is an important design
    principle of <tt>library(crypto)</tt>. For this reason, the only
    guarantee that the hash predicates give is that <i>the default
    algorithm is cryptographically secure</i>. The default may change
    in the future.  To find out which algorithm was actually used, we
    can specify the <tt>algorithm/1</tt> option, and use
    a <i>variable</i> as argument. For example:

    <pre>
?- crypto_data_hash("Hello world!", Hash, [algorithm(A)]).
   Hash = "<span class="hex">c0535e4be2b79ffd93291305436bf889314e4a3faec05ecffcbb7df31ad9e51a</span>",
   <b>A = sha256</b>.
    </pre>

    This shows that <tt>sha256</tt> is <i>currently</i> the default
    algorithm. We can use this approach to ensure interoperability
    and at the same time benefit from more secure defaults that may be
    used in the&nbsp;future.

    <br><br>

    A hash can be used to assess the <b>integrity</b> of data: By
    computing the hash and comparing it against a
    reference&nbsp;value, you can detect corruption and manipulation
    of your&nbsp;data.

    <br><br>

    This raises the question: How can we be certain that such
    a <i>reference</i>&nbsp;value is actually <i>authentic</i>, i.e.,
    truly stemming from the purported originator? One way to ensure
    the <i>authenticity</i> of data is to
    use <a href="#signatures">digital&nbsp;signatures</a>.

    <center><h3 id="passwords">Storing passwords safely</h3></center>

    Hashes can also be used to securely store
    user&nbsp;<i>passwords</i> for the purpose of authentication. In
    fact, to store a password securely, the main&nbsp;idea is
    to <i>avoid</i> storing the password altogether. Instead, we store
    only the <i>hash</i> of the password. Later, when the user enters
    a password, we compute its hash, and compare that hash against the
    stored&nbsp;value.

    <br><br>

    Two additional features make this process vastly more secure:

    <ol>
      <li>First, we make computing the hash <i>as&nbsp;slow as
        we&nbsp;can</i>. This counteracts brute-force attacks where an
        attacker tries many different passwords to find one whose hash
        matches the stored hash. One way to do this is to compute
        the <i>N</i>-fold application of the hash&nbsp;function. For
        example, <i>N</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>17</sup> makes brute-force
        attacks more than 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;times slower than applying
        the hash only&nbsp;once.
      </li>

      <li>Second, we generate a so-called <i>salt</i>, which is a list
        of random bytes that we combine with the password before it is
        hashed. We thus ensure (with extremely high probability) that
        even <i>identical</i> passwords yield <i>different</i>
        hashes. We store the salt together with the computed hash, so
        that we can use it for later reference.
      </li>
    </ol>

    All of this happens completely <i>automatically</i>
    with <b><tt>crypto_password_hash/2</tt></b></a>.

    <br><br>

    For example:

    <pre>
?- crypto_password_hash(<span class="secret">"test"</span>, Hash).
Hash = "<span class="hex">$pbkdf2-sha512$t=131072$Xj6ZIfB4U+QOeZr3ymE/AA$2KYXsPFI2zJVMb9PHVtN+pVwQ6f7LleXF8ehbyqgOmkINcIYjO8IFhz8LelwMjzidEtojRHmC0B5RQJDEB2/tw</span>".

?- crypto_password_hash(<span class="secret">"test"</span>, Hash).
Hash = "<span class="hex">$pbkdf2-sha512$t=131072$+aXCnE1r3gAFjpQ3qHcsVw$JAiD2sLbBZPQD1/FtBJUE+iWXRF0VvC/p8etsP6JGSo2dz5U+lV3a6tFDo84mluW1BufFoGZkAuaMW+K74DIaQ</span>".
    </pre>

    In this case, even though the password was the <i>same</i> in
    both&nbsp;queries, the hashes are different.

    <br><br>

    The resulting hash encapsulates everything that is necessary to
    later <i>verify</i> a password and thus authenticate
    the&nbsp;user:

    <pre>
?- crypto_password_hash(<span class="secret">"test"</span>, "<span class="hex">$pbkdf2-sha512$t=131072$+aXCnE1r3gAFjpQ3qHcsVw$JAiD2sLbBZPQD1/FtBJUE+iWXRF0VvC/p8etsP6JGSo2dz5U+lV3a6tFDo84mluW1BufFoGZkAuaMW+K74DIaQ</span>").
<b>true.</b>

?- crypto_password_hash(<span class="secret">"password"</span>, "<span class="hex">$pbkdf2-sha512$t=131072$+aXCnE1r3gAFjpQ3qHcsVw$JAiD2sLbBZPQD1/FtBJUE+iWXRF0VvC/p8etsP6JGSo2dz5U+lV3a6tFDo84mluW1BufFoGZkAuaMW+K74DIaQ</span>").
<b>false</b>.
    </pre>

    Experience shows that most users choose very predictable
    passwords, and also reuse the same passwords for different
    applications. Using <tt>crypto_password_hash/2</tt> in your
    applications makes it hard for attackers to find out which
    passwords were used, even if they manage to obtain all hashes
    you&nbsp;store.

    <br><br>

    If necessary, we can use <tt>crypto_password_hash/3</tt></a> to
    specify the applied algorithm, a custom&nbsp;salt, and the number
    of iterations.

    <center><h2 id="signatures">Digital signatures</h2></center>

    To establish the <i>authenticity</i> of data, there are different
    signature algorithms with different strengths and weaknesses.
    Common to all schemes are:

    <ol>
      <li>a <span class="secret"><i>key pair</i></span> is generated
        by the originator. The pair consists of
        a <span class="secret"><i>private&nbsp;key</i></span> and an
        associated <i>public&nbsp;key</i>.
      </li>
      <li>data is <i>signed</i> with
        the <span class="secret">private&nbsp;key</span>. This means
        that a <i>signature</i> is generated by performing a
        computation that involves the data and the private key.</li>
      <li>The signature can be <i>verified</i> by performing a
        computation that involves the data and the public&nbsp;key.
      </li>
    </ol>

    An essential property of a signature algorithm is that,
    realistically, only someone who is in possession of
    the <span class="secret">private&nbsp;key</span> can generate a
    signature that matches the data in such a way that it is
    verifiable with the corresponding public&nbsp;key.

    <br><br>

    As the names suggest, the public key can be freely shared with
    everyone, while the <span class="secret">private&nbsp;key</span>
    must be kept absolutely secret.

    <br><br>

    <tt>library(crypto)</tt> provides Ed25519, which is a specific
    instance of a digital signature scheme based on twisted Edwards
    curves. Ed25519 is an algorithm with very desirable cryptographic
    properties, and easy to use securely.

    <br><br>

    For example, we can easily create a new, cryptographically strong
    random <span class="secret"><i>key&nbsp;pair</i></span>
    using <tt>ed25519_new_keypair/1</tt>:

    <pre>
<b>?- ed25519_new_keypair(Pair).</b>
<span class="secret">   Pair = "[<i>redacted</i>]".</span>
    </pre>

    The <span class="secret">pair</span> is represented as a string
    that also includes
    the <span class="secret"><i>private&nbsp;key</i></span> and must
    therefore be kept absolutely secret. We can relate
    the <span class="secret">pair</span> to its
    <i>public&nbsp;key</i> component
    with <tt>ed25519_keypair_public_key/2</tt>. In my case, I obtained
    as public key a Prolog string whose Base64 encoding
    is <tt>"D/dkIG7mp6a0kbUeqjzxAitTIMthnKo+W6BCCMyGWyg="</tt>.

    <br><br>

    I now <i>sign</i> the message <tt>"Hello!"</tt> using <tt>ed25519_sign/4</tt>:

    <pre>
    ed25519_sign(<span class="secret">Pair</span>, "Hello!", Signature, [])
    </pre>

    where <span class="secret">Pair</span> is
    the <span class="secret">key&nbsp;pair</span> from above which
    only I know. You will never get to see
    the <span class="secret">pair's private component</span>, and
    there is no realistic way for you to compute it even if I tell you
    the associated <i>public&nbsp;key</i> (see above) and
    the <i>signature</i> that was computed,
    namely <tt>"<span class="hex">480895ab0202dd9de5e967b4ea9f12757efdfb81043dbbb8d7edf065f24ff01def8095f93bda78db91f8a34a4eff814f7dbe55ee974c92f232b74563536c3f09</span>"</tt>.

    <br><br>

    However, if you trust that I kept
    the <span class="secret">private&nbsp;key</span> absolutely
    secret, and you are certain that you have the
    correct <i>public&nbsp;key</i> that is associated with
    my <span class="secret">private&nbsp;key</span>, then you can
    use <tt>ed25519_verify/4</tt> to <i>authenticate</i> the
    string <tt>"Hello!"</tt>, which is to say, to establish beyond all
    reasonable doubt that it is I who signed it:

    <pre>
?- PublicKeyB64 = "D/dkIG7mp6a0kbUeqjzxAitTIMthnKo+W6BCCMyGWyg=",
   Message = "Hello!",
   Signature = "<span class="hex">480895ab0202dd9de5e967b4ea9f12757efdfb81043dbbb8d7edf065f24ff01def8095f93bda78db91f8a34a4eff814f7dbe55ee974c92f232b74563536c3f09</span>",
   chars_base64(PublicKey, PublicKeyB64, []),
   ed25519_verify(PublicKey, Message, Signature, []).
    </pre>

   Since this <i>succeeds</i>, the signature is <i>valid</i>.

    <center><h2 id="symmetric-encryption">Symmetric encryption</h2></center>

    We now come to the topic you are probably most interested
    in: <i>symmetric</i> encryption. This means
    that <i>the&nbsp;same</i> key is used for encrypting and
    decrypting the&nbsp;data. For example, an important use&nbsp;case
    is encrypting files with a <i>password</i>, so
    that <i>the&nbsp;same</i> password can be used to decrypt them.

    <br><br>

    Scryer Prolog makes it extremely easy to encrypt arbitrary&nbsp;data
    in a secure&nbsp;way, using the predicate
    <b><tt>crypto_data_encrypt/6</tt></b>.

    <br><br>

    In addition to the data you want to encrypt, you must provide:

    <ol>
      <li>the <b>algorithm</b> you want to use</li>
      <li>the <b>key</b> that is used for encryption</li>
      <li>the <b>initialization vector</b>&nbsp;(IV).</li>
    </ol>

    We now consider each of these parameters.

    <br><br>

    An example of a symmetric encryption <i>algorithm</i> is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"><b>AES</b></a>,
    which is a subset of the Rijndael&nbsp;cipher developed by
    Vincent&nbsp;Rijmen and Joan&nbsp;Daemen. AES is the only publicly
    accessible cipher that the NSA has approved
    for <i>top&nbsp;secret</i> information. AES is
    a <i>block&nbsp;cipher</i> and can be used in several <i>modes</i>
    that guarantee different properties.

    Ideally, <b>key</b> and <b>IV</b> are <i>randomly</i> chosen, with
    each key and&nbsp;IV being equally likely.  Reusing the same
    <i>combination</i> of key and&nbsp;IV typically leaks at least
    <i>some</i> information about the plaintext.  For example,
    identical plaintexts will then correspond to identical
    ciphertexts. For some algorithms, reusing an IV with the same key
    has disastrous results and can cause the loss of <i>all</i>
    properties that are otherwise guaranteed.  Especially in such
    cases, an IV is also called a <b>nonce</b>. This is short for
    "number used once" and emphasizes that for a fixed&nbsp;key,
    an&nbsp;IV must be used at most <i>once</i>.

    <br><br>

    We can specify keys and IVs as lists of <i>bytes</i>. We can use
    <tt>crypto_n_random_bytes/2</tt> to
    generate <i>cryptographically&nbsp;strong</i> pseudo-random bytes.
    With extremely high likelihood, each invocation will generate a
    completely different&nbsp;key and nonce.

    <br><br>

    The <i>key</i> must be kept
    absolutely <span class="secret"><i>secret</i></span> to retain the
    confidentiality of the encrypted&nbsp;text. In contrast, the IV
    can be safely stored and transmitted in plain&nbsp;text.

    <center><h3 id="authenticated-encryption">Authenticated encryption</h3></center>

    As long as the key and IV are chosen (sufficiently) randomly, AES
    in CBC mode ensures <i>confidentiality</i> of the
    plain&nbsp;text. However, the cipher falls critically short in
    other respects: It does <i>not</i> guarantee <i>integrity</i> and
    therefore also not <i>authenticity</i> of the ciphertext. This
    means that an attacker can <i>change</i> the ciphertext during
    transmission or on a storage&nbsp;device, and we <i>will not
    notice the change</i> if we only rely on this cipher. This can
    cause highly dramatic consequences. For example, suppose the
    plaintext is "<i>Send you a&nbsp;kiss!</i>", and malicious
    modifications of the ciphertext yield a deviating decrypted text
    that reads "<i>Send him a&nbsp;kiss!</i>".

    <br><br>

    There are several ways to solve this. We start&mdash;and
    end&mdash;with the
    <i>best</i> way to do it: Use a cipher that, in addition to
    confidentiality of the plaintext, <i>also</i> ensures integrity
    and authenticity of the ciphertext.

    <br><br>


    To illustrate the idea, we now use a powerful and efficient
    algorithm denoted by the atom <tt><b>'chacha20-poly1305'</b></tt>: It is
    the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/chacha.html">ChaCha20</a>
    stream&nbsp;cipher that was introduced by
    Daniel&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Bernstein, coupled with
    the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/mac.html">Poly1305</a> authenticator
    that was also introduced by Daniel&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Bernstein.

    <br><br>

    This cipher uses a 256-bit <i>key</i> and a 96-bit <i>nonce</i>,
    i.e., 32 and&nbsp;12&nbsp;<i>bytes</i>,
    respectively. Authenticated ciphers work by computing a <b>tag</b>
    that is obtained upon <i>encryption</i>, and must be supplied
    for <i>decryption</i>. The tag is obtained and supplied via
    the <tt>tag/1</tt>&nbsp;option in both cases.

    <br><br>

    For example, here is a concrete encryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305,
    using a random key and nonce:

    <pre>
?- crypto_n_random_bytes(32, <span class="secret">Ks</span>),
   crypto_n_random_bytes(12, IV),
   crypto_data_encrypt(<span class="secret"><b>"test"</b></span>, 'chacha20-poly1305', <span class="secret">Ks</span>, IV, CipherText, [<b>tag(Ts)</b>]).
    </pre>

    In response, we get the encrypted text, and a 128-bit <i>tag</i> which
    is specified as a list of 16&nbsp;bytes:

    <pre>
<span class="secret">Ks = [84,148,85,236,235,183,51,68,144|...]</span>,
IV = [182,70,102,111,6,170,45,76,148|...],
<b>CipherText = "Pç,õ"</b>,
<b>Ts = [119,23,173,207,167,255,29,135,101|...]</b>.
    </pre>

    Again, the key must be kept completely secret. In contrast,
    the tag and nonce (IV) can be safely stored and shared in
    plain&nbsp;text.


    <br><br>

    Decryption only works if the correct <i>tag</i> is supplied. For
    example:

    <pre>
?- crypto_data_decrypt($CipherText, 'chacha20-poly1305', <span class="secret">$Ks</span>, $IV, <span class="secret">PlainText</span>, [<b>tag($Ts)</b>]).
<span class="secret">PlainText = "test"</span>,
CipherText = "Pç,õ",
<span class="secret">Ks = [84,148,85,236,235,183,51,68,144|...]</span>,
IV = [182,70,102,111,6,170,45,76,148|...],
Ts = [119,23,173,207,167,255,29,135,101|...].
    </pre>

    In contrast, even if we only <i>slightly</i> shorten, extend or
    modify the ciphertext, nonce, or the required tag in any way, the
    decryption <i>fails</i>.

    <br><br>

    Thus, an attacker who changes the ciphertext must also make
    a <i>fitting</i> change in the&nbsp;tag for the change to go
    unnoticed. However, without knowing the secret key, such a change is
    extremely improbable.

    <br><br>

    Prolog is well-suited for studying how such algorithms work by
    prototyping their implementations. For example, here is a Prolog
    implementation of the Poly1305
    authenticator: <a href="poly1305aes.pl"><tt>poly1305aes.pl</tt></a>.
    And here is the ChaCha20
    core: <a href="chacha20.pl"><tt>chacha20.pl</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    <br><br>

    Before we continue, a few test runs are highly appropriate. For
    example, let us see whether we can <i>decrypt</i> the ciphertext
    if we supply the same algorithm, key and&nbsp;IV to
    <tt><b>crypto_data_decrypt/6</b></tt>. In addition, let us try
    this not only <i>once</i>, but <i>over and over</i>, with a
    freshly generated key and IV in each run:

    <pre>
?- <b>repeat</b>,
      <span class="secret">PlainText = <b>"test"</b></span>,
      Algorithm = 'chacha20-poly1305',
      crypto_n_random_bytes(32, <span class="secret">Ks</span>),
      crypto_n_random_bytes(12, IV),
      portray_clause(<b>verifying</b>),
      crypto_data_encrypt(<span class="secret">PlainText</span>, Algorithm, <span class="secret">Ks</span>, IV, CipherText, [tag(Ts)]),
      crypto_data_decrypt(CipherText, Algorithm, <span class="secret">Ks</span>, IV, <span class="secret">PlainText</span>, [tag(Ts)]),
      portray_clause(<b>ok</b>),
      <b>false</b>.
    </pre>

    As result, we get:

    <pre>
verifying.
<b>ok.</b>
verifying.
<b>ok.</b>
verifying.
<b>ok.</b>
etc.
    </pre>

    After a few hundred thousand iterations of this, we can be
    reasonably confident that what is encrypted can also be decrypted.
    When experimenting with different algorithms, it is a common error
    to specify keys or IVs that are shorter than what the chosen
    algorithm requires, and such test cases help us to detect these
    mistakes.


    <center><h3>Deriving keys and initialization vectors</h3></center>

    In most actual applications, it is not enough to generate a
    <i>random</i>&nbsp;key. Instead, we typically must find a way
    to <i>derive</i> a key and&nbsp;IV from <i>other</i> information,
    which is called <i>input keying material</i>&nbsp;(IKM).

    <br><br>

    For example, in
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman-Merkle
    key&nbsp;exchange</a>, we first negotiate
    a <i>shared&nbsp;secret</i> with another participant, and then
    must derive a suitable key from that secret. Examples of such
    secrets are integers, and points on an elliptic&nbsp;curve.

    <br><br>

    There is a standard algorithm that lets us derive keys and IVs
    from arbitrary input data. It is called <b>HKDF</b> (HMAC-based
    key derivation function), and it is described
    in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869">RFC&nbsp;5869</a>. In
    Scryer Prolog, it is available
    as <tt><b>crypto_data_hkdf/4</b></tt>.

    <br><br>

    For example, let us now derive a key and an IV from
    a <i>password</i> in such a way that entering the same password
    always yields the same key and&nbsp;IV.

    <br><br>

    Using HKDF, we <i>could</i> of course derive a key <i>directly</i>
    from a given&nbsp;password. However, consider what we said
    about <a href="#passwords">storing&nbsp;passwords</a>: First,
    attackers that try to guess the password should be slowed
    down. Second, using a password should not leak any information
    even if the same password is also used elsewhere.

    <br><br>

    Therefore, instead of <span class="secret"><i>password</i></span>
    &rightarrow; <span class="secret"><i>key</i></span>, we will do:

    <br><br>

    <span style="padding-left: 30pt"><i><span class="secret">password</span> and salt</i>
    &rightarrow; intentionally slow <span class="secret"><i>hash</i></span>
      &rightarrow; <span class="secret"><i>key</i></span>.</span>

    <br><br>


    Thus, we will now <i>combine</i> password-based hash derivation
    with HMAC-based key derivation,
    using <tt>crypto_password_hash/3</tt>
    and <i>then</i> <tt>crypto_data_hkdf/4</tt>.

    <br><br>

    To ensure that <i>the same</i> key is generated also when the same
    password is entered later, we must <i>fix</i> all parameters
    of <tt>crypto_password_hash/3</tt>. For example, recall that by
    default, a <i>random</i> salt is used. Now, we will supply our
    own&nbsp;salt, and store it for later reference. We can easily
    generate a salt with <tt>crypto_n_random_bytes/2</tt>. For
    example, let us use a 128-bit&nbsp;salt (16&nbsp;bytes). In
    addition, let us explicitly supply the algorithm we want to use
    (<tt>'pbkdf2-sha512'</tt>, which is currently the only supported
    option in any case) and also the number of iterations. For
    example, let us use 2<sup>19</sup> iterations.

    <br><br>

    From the generated <i>hash</i>, we can easily derive a
    key <i>and</i> an&nbsp;IV: The <tt>info/1</tt>&nbsp;option
    of <tt>crypto_data_hkdf/4</tt> can be used to derive several
    different keys and IVs from the same&nbsp;IKM. We also fix
    the <i>algorithm</i> that is used by <tt>crypto_data_hkdf/4</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Taking all these considerations into account, we obtain for
    example the following predicate to derive a 128-bit (i.e.,
    16&nbsp;bytes) key and&nbsp;IV from a given password and salt:

    <pre>
<b>password_salt_key_iv</b>(<span class="secret">Password</span>, Salt, <span class="secret">Ks</span>, IV) :-
        crypto_password_hash(<span class="secret">Password</span>, <span class="secret">Hash</span>, [algorithm('pbkdf2-sha512'),
                                              cost(19),
                                              salt(Salt)]),
        crypto_data_hkdf(<span class="secret">Hash</span>, 16, <span class="secret">Ks</span>, [info("key"),algorithm(sha256)]),
        crypto_data_hkdf(<span class="secret">Hash</span>, 16, IV, [info("iv"),algorithm(sha256)]).
    </pre>

    Sample usage, with a fresh 128-bit salt:

    <pre>
?- crypto_n_random_bytes(16, Salt),
   password_salt_key_iv(<span class="secret"><b>"test"</b></span>, <b>Salt</b>, <span class="secret">Ks</span>, IV).
    </pre>

    This yields:

    <pre>
Salt = [203,81,172,46,86,244,37,2,215|...],
<span class="secret"><b>Ks</b> = [38,141,86,95,83,22,243,31,38|...]</span>,
<b>IV</b> = [36,149,175,179,48,192,213,175,71|...].
    </pre>

    When we later use the same password and salt, exactly the same
    results are derived.

    <br><br>

    Thus, we only need to store the <i>salt</i> that was used, and can
    later (again) use HKDF to derive all required values when the
    password is entered. It is safe to store the salt in plain text,
    since it has no discernible or realistically computable relation
    with the derived values, as long as the <i>password</i> is kept
    completely secret.

    <br><br>

    A shared secret can be established over an insecure channel via
    elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman&nbsp;(ECDH), using the elliptic
    curve functionality of <tt>library(crypto)</tt>. Curve25519 is
    particularly well suited for this: In <tt>library(crypto)</tt>,
    points on Curve25519 are represented as <i>lists of characters</i>
    that denote the <i>u</i>-coordinate of the Montgomery curve. There
    are two predicates that let us implement X25519, a secure key
    exchange algorithm using Curve25519:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>curve25519_generator(-Gs)</tt><br>
        <i>Gs</i> is the generator point of Curve25519.
      </li>
      <li><tt>curve25519_scalar_mult(+Scalar, +Ps, -Rs)</tt><br>
        <i>Scalar</i> must be an integer between 0 and
        2<sup>256</sup>-1, or a list of 32&nbsp;bytes,
        and <i>Ps</i> must be a point on the curve. Computes the
        point <i>Rs = Scalar&middot;Ps</i> as mandated by&nbsp;X25519.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Alice and Bob can establish a shared secret over an insecure
    channel as follows, where <i>Gs</i> is the generator point of
    Curve25519:

    <ol>
      <li>
        Alice creates a random integer <i>a</i>, computes <i>As =
          a&middot;Gs</i>, and sends <i>As</i> to Bob. Instead of an
        integer <i>a</i>, Alice can
        use <tt>crypto_n_random_bytes/2</tt> to generate 32
        random&nbsp;bytes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bob creates a random integer <i>b</i>, computes <i>Bs =
          b&middot;Gs</i>, and sends <i>Bs</i> to Alice. Bob can also
        use <tt>crypto_n_random_bytes/2</tt> to
        generate&nbsp;<i>b</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice computes <i>Rs = a&middot;Bs</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bob computes <i>Rs = b&middot;As</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice and Bob use <tt>crypto_data_hkdf/4</tt> on <i>Rs</i>
        with suitable (same) parameters to obtain lists of bytes that
        can be used as keys and initialization vectors for symmetric
        encryption.
      </li>
    </ol>

    If <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are kept secret, this method is
    considered very secure.

    <br><br>

    Sometimes, keys are themselves derived from keys. For example, you
    may have a <i>master&nbsp;key</i>, and derive further keys from
    it, such as one key per file you want to encrypt. In such cases,
    you can for example specify a <i>file&nbsp;name</i> in
    the <tt>info/1</tt>&nbsp;option
    of <tt>crypto_data_hkdf/4</tt>. Even if an attacker finds out one
    of these keys, the master key remains safe. As another example,
    you could prove the <i>authenticity</i> of the cipher text by
    deriving a further key that you use to compute
    an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">HMAC</a>
    over the encrypted data and the&nbsp;IV. However, although this
    construction does not leak the primary key even if the derived key
    is broken, it is less error-prone and therefore safer to use a
    cipher with built-in support for
    <a href="#authenticated-encryption">authenticated&nbsp;encryption</a>
    for such use&nbsp;cases.

    We have barely scratched the surface of what you can and should do
    with Prolog in the context of cryptography. For example,
    <a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs564/f12/papers/blanchet_csfw01.pdf"><i>An
    Efficient Cryptographic Protocol Verifier Based on Prolog
    Rules</i></a> by Bruno Blanchet outlines how you can use Prolog to
    verify properties of a cryptographic protocol.

    <br><br>

    In many cases, you can benefit from cryptographic features even
    without knowing how they work internally. For example, if you
    simply want to enable encrypted traffic for your web applications,
    see <a href="/letswicrypt/"><b>LetSWICrypt</b></a> to set up an
    HTTPS&nbsp;server with SWI-Prolog.

    <br><br>

    In other cases, you can use the available functionality to
    implement specific applications on your own. For example, you can
    use Prolog to reason about <i>Bitcoin</i>&nbsp;addresses.
    See <a href="/bitcoinolog/"><b>Bitcoinolog</b></a> for more
    information. You can use the above methods to <i>encrypt</i> your
    Bitcoin&nbsp;wallets and other sensitive data:
    Use <a href="/enscryerypt/"><b>Enscryerypt</b></a> to encrypt and
    decrypt files.

    <br><br>

    The cryptographic functionality of Scryer Prolog is subject to
    continuous improvements. If you are interested in specific
    features, file an issue with the project, or contribute a patch!
