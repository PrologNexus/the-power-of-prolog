    <center><h2>About Prolog</h2></center>

    Prolog is a <b>programming language</b> that is rooted in
    classical <a href="logic"><b>logic</b></a>. It
    supports <i>search</i> and <i>unification</i> as built-in
    features. Prolog allows us to elegantly&nbsp;solve many&nbsp;tasks
    with short and general programs.

    <br><br>

    Prolog has a <a href="purity"><b>pure</b></a> monotonic
    core. The following documents are centered around this important
    aspect of Prolog, allowing <a href="debugging">declarative
    debugging</a> and many other approaches that are impossible or
    only rudimentarily developed in other programming languages.

    <br><br>

    A Prolog <b>program</b> consists of <b>predicates</b>. Each Prolog
    predicate defines a <b>relation</b> between its arguments. A
    relation is a generalization of a <i>function</i>. Prolog
    predicates are often more versatile than functions in other
    programming languages, and are typically usable in
    multiple <i>directions</i>.

    <br><br>

    Prolog has several
    <a href="facets"><b>facets</b></a> that distinguish it from many
    other programming languages. In addition, the language has
    undergone significant developments in the last few&nbsp;decades.
    The increasing availability of more declarative features allows us
    to present the language in a more uniform way that is easier to
    understand and at the same time yields more general programs with
    less effort than was the case with early Prolog&nbsp;versions.

    <br><br>

    The goal of this material is to <i>bridge the&nbsp;gap</i> between
    the great traditional Prolog textbooks of the&nbsp;past and the
    language <i>as it currently is</i>, several decades after these
    books were&nbsp;written. You will see that many limitations of the
    past are no longer relevant, while several new constructs are now
    of great importance even though they are not yet covered in any
    available Prolog&nbsp;book. If you are new to Prolog, read the
    chapters in&nbsp;order for a self-contained exposition of many
    important language features. If you already have some experience
    with Prolog and would like to learn more about more recent
    aspects, I recommend you start with the chapter on
    <a href="clpz">integer&nbsp;arithmetic</a> and proceed with the
    chapters it links&nbsp;to.

    <br><br>

    You can use <a href="/pceprolog/">PceProlog</a> to configure Emacs
    for Prolog&nbsp;programming.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>About you</h2></center>

    You are currently learning or teaching Prolog and find the
    existing literature somewhat unsatisfying. Is Prolog still the
    same language it was decades&nbsp;ago?  Are the existing books
    still applicable? If not, what does modern Prolog&nbsp;code
    look&nbsp;like?

    <br><br>

    You can sense that Prolog is a powerful language, yet you are
    currently unable to use&nbsp;it to its fullest&nbsp;potential.
    In fact, it sometimes seems too limited to&nbsp;you to solve
    real&nbsp;problems. On the other hand, you know that Prolog is
    the most widely used logic programming language. How can
    this&nbsp;be?

    <br><br>

    Parts of the presented material seem new and unusual
    to&nbsp;you, and even contradict what others tell&nbsp;you
    about&nbsp;Prolog. In such cases, it is only natural to ask how
    legitimate the material&nbsp;is. Can you rely on what the author
    is saying?

    <center><h2>About me</h2></center>

    In 2005, I contributed <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=simplex"><tt>library(simplex)</tt></a> to SWI-Prolog and worked on
    <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=assoc"><tt>library(assoc)</tt></a>.
    Together with a colleague, I won the online version of
    the <a href="/contests/">Prolog Programming&nbsp;Contest</a> in
    2006 and&nbsp;2007. Since&nbsp;2007, I am contributing
    the <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/man/clpfd.html">CLP(FD)&nbsp;solver</a>
    that ships with SWI-Prolog. Also since&nbsp;2007, I have been
    maintaining
    the <tt>comp.lang.prolog</tt> <a href="/prolog/faq/">Frequently
      Asked&nbsp;Questions</a>.

    <br><br>

    In 2008, I received a Master's degree from the Vienna University
    of&nbsp;Technology after solving a combinatorial optimization
    task called the <a href="/sgp/"><i>Social Golfer
        Problem</i></a>.

    <br><br>


    In 2014, I received a doctoral degree from the Vienna University
    of&nbsp;Technology in the area of Prolog and constraints. You can
    read my&nbsp;<a href="/drt.pdf">thesis</a>. Also since&nbsp;2014,
    my <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/man/clpb.html">CLP(B)&nbsp;solver</a>
    ships with SWI-Prolog. More recently, I have worked
    on <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/ssl.html%27)"><tt>library(ssl)</tt></a>.
    My last major contribution to SWI-Prolog
    is <a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=crypto"><tt>library(crypto)</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    Since 2016, I am developing my constraint libraries with Scryer
    Prolog and SICStus&nbsp;Prolog as the primary target systems.
    See <a href="https://github.com/triska/clpz">CLP(&#x2124;)</a>, and the
    SICStus&nbsp;port of&nbsp;<a href="/clpb/">CLP(B)</a> for more
    information. As of April&nbsp;2020, Scryer Prolog ships with these
    libraries as built-in features. Other libraries I contributed to
    Scryer&nbsp;Prolog
    include <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/crypto.pl"><tt>library(crypto)</tt></a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/format.pl"><tt>library(format)</tt></a>. As of November&nbsp;2020,
    <tt>library(format)</tt> also ships
    with <a href="http://tau-prolog.org/">Tau&nbsp;Prolog</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla">Trealla&nbsp;Prolog</a>.

    <br><br>

    I am author and co-author of
    several <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/t/Triska:Markus">scientific&nbsp;publications</a>
    about combinatorial optimization, Prolog and constraints. I am
    mentioned as one of the contributors to the Prolog teaching
    environment&nbsp;<a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/gupu/">GUPU</a>
    and have contributed to the Prolog
    ISO&nbsp;standard&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/iso-prolog/error_k">N226</a>).

    <br><br>

    I learned almost everything I know about Prolog from
    <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/">Ulrich
      Neumerkel</a>,
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Kral">Stefan&nbsp;Kral</a>,

    and <a href="https://www.sics.se/people/mats-carlsson">Mats&nbsp;Carlsson</a>.

    <br><br>

    What does this all mean? All considered, you still have to
    draw your own conclusions. Good&nbsp;luck!
