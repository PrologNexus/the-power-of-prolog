    <h1>Writing Prolog Programs</h1>
    <br><br>

    The best general advice on <i>writing</i> Prolog code was given by
    Richard O'Keefe in his book <i>The Craft of&nbsp;Prolog</i>:

    <div>
      <blockquote class="box">
        <b>Elegance is not optional.</b>
      </blockquote>
    </div>

    Take this advice to heart! If your Prolog code seems somewhat
    inelegant, <i>pause</i> and think about how it can be made
    more&nbsp;elegant.

    <br><br>

    This page explains a few additional guidelines for writing
    Prolog&nbsp;code.

    <h2>How to begin</h2>

    Consider a relation like <tt>list_list_together/3</tt> that is
    mentioned in <a href="reading">Reading Prolog&nbsp;Programs</a>.
    How do we come up with such a definition in the first place?
    <br><br>

    When <i>writing</i> a Prolog predicate, think about
    <i>the conditions that ought to make it&nbsp;true</i>. For
    example, in the case of <tt>list_list_together/3</tt>, we can
    proceed as follows: First, we want to describe a relation that
    holds for&nbsp;<a href="data#list"><i>lists</i></a>. We know from
    their inductive definition that we need to consider at least two
    possible cases:
    <ol>
      <li>the <i>atom</i>&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt></li>
      <li>compound terms of the form <tt>[L|Ls]</tt></li>
    </ol>

    These two cases form the skeleton of our prospective definition:

    <pre>
list_list_together([], Bs, Cs) :-
        ...
list_list_together([L|Ls], Bs, Cs) :-
        ...
    </pre>

    These two clauses form logical <i>alternatives</i> that describe
    the different <i>cases</i> that can arise. Then, we
    ask: <i>When</i>, i.e., under what <i>conditions</i> do these
    cases <i>hold</i>? If you think about it, you will come to the
    conclusion that the first clause
    holds <i>if</i> <tt>Bs&nbsp;=&nbsp;Cs</tt>, so we can write it as:

    <pre>
list_list_together([], Bs, Cs) :-
        Bs = Cs.
    </pre>

    Such unifications can always be pulled into the clause head, so
    we can write it as:

    <pre>
list_list_together([], Bs, Bs).
    </pre>

    We apply the same reasoning to the second clause: <i>When</i> does
    it hold that <tt>Cs</tt> is the concatenation of <tt>[L|Ls]</tt>
    and&nbsp;<tt>Bs</tt>? A bit of reflection tells us: This
    holds <i>if</i> <tt>Cs</tt> is of the
    form&nbsp;<tt>[L|Rest]</tt> <i>and</i> <tt>Rest</tt> is the
    concatenation of&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>Bs</tt>. We use
    the <a href="concepts#builtin">built-in</a>
    predicate&nbsp;<tt>(',')/2</tt> to express this <i>conjunction</i>
    of conditions. To describe that <tt>Rest</tt> is the concatenation
    of <tt>Ls</tt> and <tt>Bs</tt>, we use <tt>list_list_together(Ls,
    Bs, Rest)</tt>, since this is precisely the relation that ought
    to <i>hold</i> in this&nbsp;case.

    <br><br>

    The whole clause therefore becomes:

    <pre>
list_list_together([L|Ls], Bs, Cs) :-
        Cs = [L|Rest],
        list_list_together(Ls, Bs, Rest).
    </pre>

    This is an example of a predicate whose definition refers to
    itself. Such predicates are called <i>recursive</i>. Note how
    recursive definitions naturally arise from considering the
    conditions that make such predicates&nbsp;true.

    <br><br>

    Again, we can simply pull the unification into the clause head:

    <pre>
list_list_together([L|Ls], Bs, [L|Rest]) :-
        list_list_together(Ls, Bs, Rest).
    </pre>

    Finding better variable names is left as an exercise.

    <br><br>

    When beginners write their first Prolog&nbsp;programs, a common
    mistake is to ask the <i>wrong</i> question: "What should
    Prolog <i>do</i> in this case?". This question is misguided:
    Especially as a beginner, you will not be able to grasp the actual
    control flow for the different modes of invocation. In addition,
    this question typically limits you to only one possible usage mode
    of your predicate. Therefore, do not fall into this&nbsp;trap!
    Instead, think about the conditions that <i>make the
    relation&nbsp;hold</i>, and provide a clear declarative
    description of these conditions. If you manage to state these
    conditions correctly, you often naturally obtain very general
    predicates that can be used in several directions. Thus, when
    writing Prolog&nbsp;code, better ask: <i>What are the cases and
      conditions that make this predicate&nbsp;true</i>?

    <br><br>

    You may now think: That's all OK, and may work for such simple
    relations. But what if I want to actually "do" something, such as
    incrementing a&nbsp;counter, removing an element etc.? The answer
    is still the same: Think in terms of <i>relations</i> between the
    entities you are describing. To express a <i>modification</i> of
    something, you should define a relation between
    different <i>states</i> of something, and state the conditions
    that make this relation&nbsp;<i>hold</i>.
    See <a href="/tist/"><i>Thinking in&nbsp;States</i></a> for more
    information.

    <h2>Naming predicates</h2>

    A good <i>predicate&nbsp;name</i> makes clear what the predicate
    arguments <i>mean</i>.

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/naming_predicates"><img src="videos/t_naming_predicates.png" alt="Naming Prolog Predicates"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br><br>

    Ideally, a predicate can be used in <i>all</i> directions. This
    means that <i>any</i> argument may be a variable, partially
    instantiated, or fully instantiated. This generality should
    be <i>expressed</i> in the predicate name, typically by
    choosing <i>nouns</i> to describe the arguments.

    <br><br>

    Examples of <b>good</b> predicate names are:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>list_length/2</tt>, relating a list to its length</li>
      <li><tt>integer_successor/2</tt>, relating an integer to its
        successor</li>
      <li><tt>student_course_grade/3</tt>, relating students to
        courses and grades.</li>
    </ul>

    In these cases, the predicate names are so clear that the
    descriptions seem almost superfluous. Note also
    that <tt>using_underscores_makes_also_longer_names_easy_to_read</tt>,
    whereas for
    example <tt>mixingTheCasesAsInJavaMakesThatALotHarderInGeneral</tt>.

    <br><br>

    For these reasons, examples of <b>bad</b> names are:

    <ul>
      <li><tt>length/2</tt>: Which argument is the length, the first
      or the second one?</li>
      <li><tt>nextInteger/2</tt>: Not as readable as for
        example <tt>next_integer/2</tt>, and not as meaningful
        as <tt>integer_successor/2</tt>.</li>
      <li><tt>fetch_grades/3</tt>: Does not make sense for example if
        grades are already <i>instantiated</i>.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Naming variables</h2>

    A Prolog <b>variable</b> starts with an uppercase letter <i>or</i>
    with an underscore. The latter rule is useful to know if you are
    teaching Prolog in Japan, for example.

    <br><br>

    In contrast to the convention for <i>predicate</i>
    names, <tt>MixedCases</tt> are sometimes used when naming
    Prolog <i>variables</i>. However, the mixing is in almost all
    cases limited to at most <i>two</i> uppercase words that are
    adjoined.

    <br><br>

    Some Prolog predicates describe a sequence
    of <a href="/tist/"><i>state&nbsp;transitions</i></a> to express
    state changes in a pure way. In such cases, the following
    convention can be very useful: The initial state is denoted
    as <tt>State0</tt>, the next state is <tt>State1</tt>, etc. This
    enumeration continues until the final state, which we
    call&nbsp;<tt>State</tt>. In total, the sequence is therefore:

    <br><br>
    <pre>
State0 &rightarrow; State1 &rightarrow; State2 &rightarrow; ... &rightarrow; State
    </pre>

    Of course, the prefix <tt>State</tt> can denote any other entity
    that is being described. For example, if multiple elements are
    inserted into an <a href="data#assoc">association&nbsp;list</a>,
    we may have the sequence:

    <br><br>
    <pre>
Assoc0 &rightarrow; Assoc1 &rightarrow; Assoc2 &rightarrow; ... &rightarrow; Assoc
    </pre>

    When writing <a href="metapredicates">higher-order
      predicates</a>, it is good practice to denote
    with <tt>C_<i>N</i></tt> a closure&nbsp;<tt>C</tt> that is
    called with <i>N</i> additional arguments. For example, the
    first argument of <tt>maplist/2</tt> could be
    called&nbsp;<tt>Pred_1</tt>, because it is invoked
    with <i>one</i> additional argument.

    <h2>Indenting Prolog code</h2>

    Prolog is a very simple language: Only a few language constructs
    exist, and several ways for indenting them are common.

    <br><br>

    However, no matter which convention you choose, one invariant that
    should always be adhered to is to <i>never place <tt>(;)/2</tt> at
    the end of a line</i>. This is because <tt>;</tt> looks very
    similar to&nbsp;<tt>,</tt>&nbsp;(comma). Since <tt>(',')/2</tt>
    almost always occurs at the end of a line, it is good practice to
    place <tt>;</tt> either at the <i>beginning</i> of a line
    or <i>between</i> the two goals of a disjunction to more clearly
    distinguish it from a conjunction.

    <h2>Comments</h2>

    You can use <i>comments</i> in your code to explain important
    principles and design goals of your programs.

    <br><br>

    Prolog supports two kinds of <i>comments</i>:

    <ul>
      <li><i>single line comment</i>, starting with <tt>%</tt> and
        including everything up to (and including) the
        next <i>newline</i> character</li>
      <li><i>bracketed comment</i>, which has the form

        <pre>
/* comment text */
        </pre>

        A bracketed comment may also include newline characters
        between the delimiters.
      </li>
    </ul>

    By convention, supported <i>modes</i> of predicates are sometimes
    indicated in comments. Such comments consist of the predicate
    head, and indicate the supported modes for each argument using a
    dedicated prefix for each argument. For example, such a comment
    may read:

    <pre>
list_list_together(?As, ?Bs, ?Cs)
    </pre>

    where "<tt>?</tt>" means that the respective argument may be a
    variable, only partially instantiated <i>or</i> fully instantiated
    when the predicate is invoked. Other common prefices are
    "<tt>+</tt>" and "<tt>-</tt>", denoting intended <i>input</i>
    and <i>output</i> arguments, respectively.

    <br><br>

    Such mode annotations may be augmented with the <i>determinism</i>
    specifiers <tt>semidet</tt>, <tt>det</tt>, <tt>multi</tt>
    and <tt>nondet</tt>, indicating whether the predicate succeeds,
    respectively, at most once, exactly once, at least once, or
    arbitrarily often.
