    </ul>
    

    <h2 id="simple"><center>Prolog is a very simple language</center></h2>

    It is easy to describe Prolog <b>syntax</b> in sufficient detail
    to start working with Prolog immediately.

    <br><br>

    All <a href="data">data</a> are represented by
    Prolog&nbsp;<a href="data#term"><b>terms</b></a>.

    <br><br>

    There is a single language element, called
    a <a href="concepts#clause"><i>clause</i></a>. A clause is of the
    form:
    <br><br>

    <div style="padding-left: 3em">
      <b><tt>Head :- Body.</tt></b>
    </div>

    <br>

    This means that <b>if</b> <tt>Body</tt>
    holds, <b>then</b> <tt>Head</tt> holds. The infix
    operator <tt>(:-)/2</tt> represents an arrow from right to
    left:&nbsp;&leftarrow;.

    <br><br>

    If <tt>Head</tt> <i>always</i>
    holds, then <tt>:-&nbsp;Body</tt> can be&nbsp;<i>omitted</i>.

    <br><br>

    <i>The above is enough to write useful first Prolog programs.</i>

    <br><br>

    <b>You may not believe this</b>, so witness the evidence: All
    programs presented in the following consist <i>only</i> of such
    clauses.

    <br><br>

    In fact, <i>all known computations</i> can be described in terms
    of such&nbsp;clauses, making Prolog
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing&nbsp;complete</a>
    programming&nbsp;language. One way to implement a
    Turing&nbsp;machine in Prolog is to describe the <i>relation</i>
    between different&nbsp;states of the machine with clauses of the
    form "<i>If</i> the current state is&nbsp;<tt>S0</tt> <i>and</i>
    the symbol under the tape&nbsp;head is&nbsp;<tt>T</tt>, <i>and</i>
    ... <i>then</i> the next state is&nbsp;<tt>S</tt>".
    See <a href="showcases/turing.pl"><tt>turing.pl</tt></a> for one
    implementation, and <a href="/tist/"><i>Thinking
    in&nbsp;States</i></a> for more information.

    <h2 id="declarative"><center>Prolog is a declarative language</center></h2>

    Prolog is a <i>declarative language</i>. This means that we focus
    on stating <i>what</i> we are interested in. We <a href="writing">express
      what <i>holds</i></a> about solutions we want to find. We are less
    concerned about <i>how</i> the Prolog implementation finds these
    solutions.

    <br><br>

    This declarative nature often allows for very concise, clear and
    general specifications. It is unlikely that shorter formalisms
    that are equally clear and expressive exist.

    <br><br>

    For example, let us describe the <i>relation</i> between
    a <a href="data#list">list</a> and its length,
    using <a href="clpz">integer&nbsp;arithmetic</a>:

    <div class="box" style="float: right; width: 30%">
      <b>Note</b>: In <i>some</i> Prolog systems, you currently need to
      include a dedicated library to use declarative integer
      arithmetic. <a href="clpz">More...</a>
    </div>

    <pre>
list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        N #= N0 + 1,
        list_length(Ls, N0).
    </pre>

    We can <a href="reading#declarative"><b>read this declaratively</b></a> as follows:

    <ol>
      <li>The length of the <i>empty list</i>&nbsp;<tt>[]</tt> is &nbsp;0.</li>
      <li><b>If</b> the length of the list&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>
        is&nbsp;<tt>N0</tt> <b>and</b> <tt>N</tt>
        is <tt>N0+1</tt>, <b>then</b> the length
        of&nbsp;<tt>[_|Ls]</tt> is&nbsp;<tt>N</tt>. Further, this only
        holds <b>if</b> <tt>N</tt> is <i>greater than</i>&nbsp;0.
    </ol>

    When programming in Prolog, think in terms of <i>relations</i>
    between entities. Your programs will become very general with this
    approach. In the above example, it is tempting to think and say
    "We are computing the length of a list". And yes, it is true: We
    can indeed use the above definition to compute the length of
    a&nbsp;list:

    <pre>
?- list_length([a,b,c], L).
   L = 3.
    </pre>

    However, this <i>imperative</i> reading does not do justice to
    what we have actually implemented, because the definition also
    covers several additional usage&nbsp;patterns. For
    example, <i>given</i> a specific length, we can ask <i>whether</i>
    there are lists of that length:

    <pre>
?- list_length(Ls, 3).
   Ls = [_A,_B,_C]
;  false.
    </pre>

    Using the <b>most general query</b>, we can even ask for all
    answers that Prolog finds <i>in&nbsp;general</i>:

    <pre>
?- list_length(Ls, L).
   Ls = [], L = 0
;  Ls = [_A], L = 1
;  Ls = [_A,_B], L = 2
;  Ls = [_A,_B,_C], L = 3
;  ...
    </pre>

    We say that the relation is usable in different <i>modes</i>.
    Characteristically, Prolog reports all answers
    via&nbsp;<i>backtracking</i>.

    <br><br>

    The predicate <tt>length/2</tt> is part of
    the <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/iso-prolog/prologue">Prologue
    for Prolog</a> draft, and already available as
    a <a href="concepts#builtin">built-in</a> predicate in almost all
    Prolog implementations with the above semantics.

    <h2 id="logic"><center>Prolog is a logic programming language</center></h2>

    In the category of <i>declarative</i> languages, we
    find <i>functional</i> programming languages and <i>logic</i>
    programming languages. A function is a special case of a relation,
    and functional programming can be regarded as a restricted form of
    logic&nbsp;programming.

    <br><br>

    Prolog is firmly rooted in <a href="logic"><b>logic</b></a>. <br><br>

    A <a href="purity">pure</a> Prolog program consists of a set
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn&nbsp;clauses</a>.

    Its execution can be regarded as a special case
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)"><i>resolution</i></a>.

    <br><br>

    This connection to formal logic allows us to apply powerful
    <a href="debugging"><b>declarative&nbsp;debugging</b></a> techniques that
    are based on logical properties of the program.  For example,
    adding a <i>constraint</i> can at most <i>reduce</i> the set of
    solutions, and adding a&nbsp;<i>clause</i> can at most extend
    it. This property of pure Prolog programs is
    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_of_entailment">monotonicity</a>.

    <br><br>

    <i>See
      the <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/gupu/"><b>GUPU
      system</b></a> by Ulrich Neumerkel for an impressive application
      of these&nbsp;ideas.</i>

    <h2 id="homoiconic"><center>Prolog is a homoiconic language</center></h2>

    <div style="padding: 10pt; margin-left: 70%; display: inline-block; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: right">
      <i>homoiconic</i>: from ὁμοιος = "similar" and εικών = "image"
    </div>
    <br><br>

    Prolog <i>programs</i> are also valid Prolog <i>terms</i>! This
    has many great advantages: It is easy to write Prolog programs
    that analyze, transform and interpret <i>other</i> Prolog
    programs. You can use the built-in predicate <tt>read/1</tt> to
    read a Prolog&nbsp;term, and thus also a Prolog&nbsp;clause.

    <br><br>

    There is a powerful <a href="macros">mechanism</a> to rewrite
    Prolog programs at compilation time, so that you can easily
    implement domain-specific languages that help you solve your tasks
    more naturally.

    <br><br>
    <b>You may not believe this</b>, because some goals&mdash;such
    as <tt>list_length(Ls,&nbsp;N)</tt>&mdash;look like
    Prolog&nbsp;terms as defined above, whereas other goals&mdash;such
    as&nbsp;<tt>N&nbsp;#&gt;&nbsp;0</tt>&mdash;look quite different.
    The reason for this is that Prolog provides prefix, infix and
    postfix&nbsp;<i>operators</i> that let you write Prolog&nbsp;terms
    in a more readable way. For example, the Prolog
    term&nbsp;<tt>+(a,b)</tt> can also be written using
    operator&nbsp;notation as&nbsp;<tt>a+b</tt>.
    The <i>abstract&nbsp;syntax</i> remains completely uniform, and
    you can read and process all Prolog terms independent of how they
    are written&nbsp;down.

    <br><br>
    <i>You can dynamically define custom operators for specific use cases.</i>

    <h2 id="dynamic"><center>Prolog is a very dynamic language</center></h2>

    Prolog programs can be easily created, called and modified <i>at
    run time</i>. This further increases the expressiveness of Prolog
    and lets you implement <a href="metapredicates">higher-order
    predicates</a> which have other predicates as arguments. It also
    allows the implementation of very dynamic techniques
    like <i>adaptive&nbsp;parsing</i>.

    <br><br>

    The dynamic nature of Prolog also makes the language ideally
    suited for writing programs that are <i>extensible</i> by
    custom&nbsp;rules that other programmers and even regular users
    provide. <a href="/proloxy/"><b>Proloxy</b></a>
    and <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit
    Code&nbsp;Review</a> are examples of this approach: You configure
    these programs by supplying
    Prolog&nbsp;<a href="concepts#rule">rules</a> that express your
    requirements in a very readable and flexible&nbsp;way.

    <br><br>
    See <a href="/acomip/"><b>A Couple of
        Meta-interpreters in&nbsp;Prolog</b></a> for more information.

    <br><br>

    <i>You can define an interpreter for pure Prolog in two lines of
      Prolog&nbsp;code.</i>

    <h2 id="versatile"><center>Prolog is a very versatile language</center></h2>

    Prolog is an extremely versatile language. Its relational nature
    makes Prolog programs very flexible and general. This plays an
    important role in language processing and knowledge representation
    in&nbsp;<a href="business#database">databases</a>. Modern Prolog
    systems provide everything that is needed for solving
    simple <a href="puzzles">logic&nbsp;puzzles</a> to building huge
    applications, ranging from
    <a href="web">web&nbsp;hosting</a>
    to <a href="theoremproving">verification</a>
    and <a href="optimization">optimization</a> tasks.

    <br><br>

    Prolog's versatility and power are rooted in <i>implicit</i>
    mechanisms that include search, unification, argument indexing and
    constraint propagation. You can use these mechanisms to your
    advantage, and <i>delegate</i> many tasks to the
    Prolog&nbsp;engine.
