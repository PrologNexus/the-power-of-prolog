    <center><h1>Debugging Prolog Programs</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    First, a note on terminology: In the following, the
    word <b>mistake</b> is used <i>instead</i> of "bug". The reasons
    for this are:

    <ul>
      <li><i>We</i> are making these mistakes. They do not occur by themselves.</li>
      <li>Mistakes in software should be taken seriously. We should
        not trivialize them or find excuses.</li>
      <li>Mistakes should be <i>corrected</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    We now consider <i>declarative</i> ways to <i>locate</i>
    and <i>correct</i> mistakes in Prolog programs. The techniques we
    explain have been invented and popularized
    by <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/">Ulrich
    Neumerkel</a> in the Prolog teaching environment
    <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/papers/PDF/#2002-wlpe"><b>GUPU</b></a>.

    <br><br>
    
    The methods are based on declarative ways
    of <a href="reading"><b>reading Prolog programs</b></a>,
    exploiting logical properties to quickly narrow down mistakes.  We
    call this approach <b>declarative&nbsp;debugging</b>.


    <center><h2>Tracing falls short</h2></center>

    When you detect a mistake in a Prolog program, and you are used to
      procedural languages, you may try to think about the Prolog
      program mostly <i>procedurally</i> and attempt to understand its
      control flow by <i>tracing</i> the computation. There are
    several tools that help you with this: Try

    <pre>
?- trace, your_goal.
    </pre>

    and

    <pre>
?- gtrace, your_goal.
    </pre>

    to trace your programs in textual or graphical tracers that your
    Prolog system provides.

    <br><br>

    Unfortunately, <b>tracing falls short</b> in several critical respects.
    One important reason is that tracers are <i>programs</i>
    and <i>also</i> contain mistakes. Very often, and especially for
    more complex programs, you will wrestle with mistakes, omissions
    and shortcomings in the tracer <i>in&nbsp;addition</i> to mistakes
    in your program. Another important reason is that traces quickly
    get very&nbsp;<i>complex</i> and hard to understand. Finally,
    using tracers only further encourages procedural thinking, which
    makes it even harder for you to learn more elegant techniques and
    practices for locating mistakes in declarative programs.

    <br><br>

    For these reasons, we focus on <i>declarative</i> approaches in
    this text. They are easy to apply, let you quickly locate
    mistakes, and encourage the use of declarative techniques that
    also make declarative approaches for locating mistakes more widely
    applicable.
    

    <center><h2>Mistakes in a Prolog program</h2></center>

    There are two main ways in which a pure Prolog program
    that <i>terminates</i> can be wrong. It can be:

    <ul>
      <li><i>too general</i></li>
      <li><i>too specific</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    A Prolog program is too <b>general</b> if it yields solutions that
    are not intended. A Prolog program is too <b>specific</b> if
    intended solutions are not reported. In the former
    case, <i>constraints</i> must be added to rule out unintended
    solutions. In the latter case, the program must
    be <i>generalized</i>. These cases are <i>not</i> mutually
    exclusive: A Prolog program may be too general <i>and</i> too
    specific.

    <br><br>

    When beginners write their first Prolog programs, they frequently
    ask: "<i>Why</i> does my predicate fail?" This means that their
    predicate fails <i>although they intend it to succeed</i>. It
    means that their predicate is <i>too&nbsp;specific</i> and must
    be <i>generalized</i>. The question itself is perfectly adequate:
    Notice how natural it is to ask for the <i>why</i>. It would be
    extremely inconvenient and in most cases almost impossible to
    follow the exact <i>steps</i> that Prolog performs,
    i.e., <i>how</i> it fails. We care more about
    high-level <i>explanations</i> than about low-level <i>traces</i>.
    We will thus use Prolog to locate the <i>reasons</i> for
    unintended failures, i.e., those parts of our programs
    that <i>cause</i> unintended failures.


    <center><h2>Example: Length of a list</h2></center>

    Let us consider a simple Prolog program that <i>contains a
      <b>mistake</b></i>:

    
    <pre>
list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        N #= N0 + 2,
        list_length(Ls, N0).
    </pre>

    Our intention is to describe the relation between a <i>list</i>
    and its&nbsp;<i>length</i>. We can use the methods described
    in <a href="testing"><b>Declarative Testing</b></a> to detect
    that the program is <i>too specific</i> because the following
    query <i>incorrectly</i> <b>fails</b>:

    <pre>
?- list_length([_], 1).
   false.
    </pre>

    In fact, the program is also <i>too general</i>, because the
    following query <b>succeeds</b> unintentionally:

    <pre>
?- list_length([_], 2).
   true.
    </pre>

    Note that we declaratively reason about the <i>meaning</i> of the
    program, without attempting to understand details of the
    computation.
    
    <center><h2>Locating mistakes</h2></center>

    How can we find the precise <b>location</b> of mistakes in our
    program? A very nice method, applicable for the
    the <a href="purity"><b>pure</b></a> monotonic subset of
    Prolog, was described by Ulrich Neumerkel in a posting to the
    SWI-Prolog mailing list, and we will use his technique here.

    <br><br>

    The idea is to make the following definitions available in your programs:

    <div>
      <pre class="box">
:- op(920,fy, *).

*_. </pre>
    </div>

    In Scryer Prolog, <tt>(*)/1</tt> is available in <a href="https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/blob/master/src/lib/debug.pl"><tt>library(debug)</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    Putting <tt>(*)/1</tt> in front of a goal lets us <b>generalize
        away</b> the goal. This means that the goal is treated as if
    it were not stated <i>at&nbsp;all</i>. We could also "comment&nbsp;out"
    the goal, but using <tt>(*)/1</tt> is a lot more convenient
    because it also works for the <i>last</i>&nbsp;goal of a
    clause, whereas "commenting&nbsp;out" the&nbsp;period would lead
    to syntax errors. In the following, we use <s>strikeout</s>
    text to denote that the goal is treated as if it did not
    appear at&nbsp;all.

    <br><br>

    We start by generalizing away <i>all</i> explicit goals:

    <pre>
list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        <b>*</b> <s>N #&gt; 0</s>,
        <b>*</b> <s>N #= N0 + 2</s>,
        <b>*</b> <s>list_length(Ls, N0)</s>.
    </pre>

    This makes the program significantly <i>more general</i>. Of
    course it is now much <i>too</i> general, but at least it is no
    longer too specific. In particular, the query that previously
    unintentionally <i>failed</i> now <i>succeeds</i>:

    <pre>
?- list_length([_], 1).
   true.
    </pre>

    By systematically removing some of the <tt>(*)/1</tt> we
    introduced, we can <b>narrow down</b> the mistake. In particular,
    if we use the following definition:

    <pre>
list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        * <s>N #= N0 + 2</s>,
        list_length(Ls, N0).
    </pre>

    then the query still <i>succeeds</i>, but if we <i>include</i> the
    single goal that is now still generalized away, then the
    query <i>fails</i> again. Therefore, <b>check this goal for
    mistakes</b>! A bit of reflection quickly leads to the following
    correction:

    <pre>
list_length([], 0).
list_length([_|Ls], N) :-
        N #&gt; 0,
        N #= N0 + <b>1</b>,
        list_length(Ls, N0).
    </pre>

    This corrected program passes all tests explained
    in <a href="testing"><b>Declarative Testing</b></a>.

    <center><h2>Appreciating the technique</h2></center>

    Let us briefly pause and reflect on the approach outlined above.
    Clearly, the method is based on the following important property:

    <blockquote>
      <b>Removing a goal</b> can make a predicate
      at most <b>more&nbsp;general</b>, <i>never</i> more specific.
    </blockquote>

    This property clearly <b>holds</b> for pure and monotonic
    Prolog&nbsp;code. That is
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing&nbsp;complete</a>
    subset of Prolog and therefore suffices to express all
    computations that are currently known. However, solely for the
    sake of argument, suppose that your application ideas are so
    colossal that they <i>exceed</i> the expressiveness of this
    fragment. Even if that were the case, it would <i>still</i> be
    remarkable that such a strong, general statement can be made about
    how <i>changes</i> to a program affect its meaning. Since that
    fragment is, in reality, as expressive as the whole language in
    computational terms, it is all the <i>more</i> remarkable!

    <br><br>

    In fact, Prolog is rather unique due to this property alone
    already. Compare this property to other programming languages: How
    do comparable changes in a Java, C++ or Haskell program affect its
    meaning? For example, what changes if you remove
    a <tt>for</tt>&nbsp;loop in a Java program,
    an <tt>if-then-else</tt> block in a C++ program, or one of the
    lines in a <tt>do</tt> block in a Haskell program? Does such a
    program even <i>compile</i> in all cases?

    <br><br>

    Can you make any such statement for <i>any</i> fragment
    of <i>any</i> programming language other than Prolog?

    <br><br>

    There are many other interesting properties that <i>also</i> hold
    for pure and monotonic Prolog&nbsp;code, and which can be
    exploited for locating mistakes in our programs. It is our hope
    that the availability and usefulness of such declarative methods
    encourage you to value and retain logical&nbsp;purity of your
    Prolog programs.
