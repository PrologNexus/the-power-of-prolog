    <center><h1>Basic Concepts</h1></center>
    <br>

    We introduce and define the most basic <b>concepts</b> of Prolog.

    <center><h2>Terms</h2></center>

    In Prolog, <i>all data</i>&mdash;including
    Prolog <i>programs</i>&mdash;are represented by
    Prolog <a href="data#term"><b>terms</b></a>.

    <center><h2 id="program">Programs</h2></center>

    A Prolog <b>program</b> is a set of <i>predicates</i>.

    <br><br>

    Predicates define <b>relations</b> between their
    arguments. Logically, a Prolog program states what&nbsp;<i>holds</i>.

    <br><br>

    There are a few conventions
    for <a href="writing"><b>writing</b></a> Prolog programs, and
    different ways of <a href="reading"><b>reading</b></a> them.

    <center><h3 id="predicate">Predicates</h3></center>

    Each <b>predicate</b> has a <i>name</i>, and zero or
    more <i>arguments</i>. The predicate <b>name</b> is a
    Prolog&nbsp;<i>atom</i>. Each <b>argument</b> is an arbitrary
    Prolog&nbsp;term.

    <br><br>

    A predicate with name <i>Pred</i> and <i>N</i> arguments is
    denoted by <i>Pred</i>/<i>N</i>, which is called
    a <b>predicate&nbsp;indicator</b>. <i>N</i> is called
    the <b>arity</b> of the predicate.

    <br><br>

      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/predicates"><img src="videos/t_predicates.png" alt="Predicates"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    A predicate is defined by a collection of <i>clauses</i>.

    <br><br>

    <div id="clause">
      A <b>clause</b> is either a <i>rule</i> or a <i>fact</i>. The
      clauses that constitute a predicate denote
      logical <i>alternatives</i>: If <i>any</i> clause is true, then
      the whole predicate is&nbsp;true.
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/clauses"><img src="videos/t_clauses.png" alt="Clauses, Rules and Facts"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <center><h3 id="rule">Rules</h3></center>

    A Prolog <b>rule</b> has the form:

    <pre>
<i>Head</i> :- <i>Body</i>.
    </pre>

    The notation of the <b>head</b> of a rule depends on the number of
    arguments:

    <ul>
      
      <li>If the predicate has <i>zero</i>
	arguments, then the head consists only of the predicate name.</li>
      <li>If a predicate called <i>Name</i> has a <i>positive</i>
	number&nbsp;<i>N</i> of arguments, then the head is written
	as:
<tt><i>Name</i>(<i>Arg</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Arg</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., <i>Arg</i><sub>N</sub>)</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    The <b>body</b> of each rule is a Prolog <i>goal</i>.

    <br><br>
    
    A <b>goal</b> is a Prolog term that denotes a predicate and its arguments.

    <br><br>

    A rule is called <b>recursive</b> if one of its goals refers to
    the predicate that the rule is defining.

    <center><h3 id="fact">Facts</h3></center>

    A <b>fact</b> is written as:

    <pre>
<i>Head</i>.
    </pre>

    This is equivalent to the <a href="#rule">rule</a>:
    
    <pre>
<i>Head</i> :- <b>true</b>.
    </pre>

    Logically, this means that the rule <i>always&nbsp;holds</i>,
    because the <a href="#builtin">built-in</a>
    predicate <tt>true/0</tt> is always&nbsp;true.

    <center><h2 id="toplevel">Toplevel</h2></center>


    The Prolog <b>toplevel</b> is the main way in which we <i>run</i>
    Prolog programs.

    <br><br>

    We invoke a Prolog predicate by posting a <b>query</b> on the
    toplevel. A query is an arbitrary Prolog&nbsp;<i>goal</i>. In a
    query, variables are <i>existentially</i> quantified. We can thus
    read a query as: "Are there any cases for which the given
    predicate&nbsp;<i>holds</i>?"

    <br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/queries"><img src="videos/t_queries.png" alt="Clauses, Rules and Facts"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    If the goal succeeds, then the toplevel reports an <b>answer</b>.
    The answer is a Prolog goal that is
    declaratively <i>equivalent</i> to the query.

    <br><br>

    Every predicate has an associated <b>most general query</b>, which
    means that <i>all arguments are fresh&nbsp;variables</i>.

    <br><br>

    Note that a goal can succeed <i>more than once</i>. Depending on
    your Prolog implementation, you either press <tt>SPACE</tt>
    or&nbsp;";" to see alternatives.

    <center><h2>Running Prolog code</h2></center>

    Running a Prolog program can be regarded as a special case
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)"><b>resolution</b></a>, which is an algorithm that is rooted in
    formal&nbsp;logic. Logically, when Prolog answers a query, it
    tries to find a <i>resolution&nbsp;refutation</i> of the negated
    query and the set of clauses that constitute the program. When a
    refutation is found, it means that the query is a
    logical <b>consequence</b> of the program.

    <br><br>

    An important step in this process is syntactic <b>unification</b>
    of terms. Unification is a generalization of <i>pattern
    matching</i>. When a clause head is chosen for unification with a
    Prolog goal, then unification applies to the arguments
    of&nbsp;<i>both</i>.

    <br><br>

    For this reason, there is <i>no distinction</i> between input and
    output arguments of <a href="purity">pure</a> predicates, and
    Prolog predicates can often be used in several directions.

    <br><br>

    If multiple clause heads unify with a goal, then alternatives are
    tried on <b>backtracking</b>.

    <br><br>

    Informally, you can think of Prolog's default execution strategy,
    which is called <i>depth-first search with chronological
    backtracking</i>, as a generalization
    of <i>function&nbsp;calls</i> that are available in other
    languages. The main differences are that: (1)&nbsp;multiple
    clauses can match and (2)&nbsp;unification works in both
    directions.

    <br><br>

    A Prolog&nbsp;program can be interpreted with <i>different</i>
    execution strategies that can be flexibly
    selected. <a href="memoization.html#tabling">SLG&nbsp;resolution</a>
    is an alternative execution strategy that is available in an
    increasing number of Prolog&nbsp;systems. The ability to use
    different execution strategies while keeping the program unchanged
    is a major attraction of Prolog.

    <br><br>
    To find mistakes in Prolog programs,
    it is typically <i>not necessary</i> to trace the actual execution
    steps. Instead, <a href="debugging"><b>declarative
    debugging</b></a> techniques can be applied to narrow down
    mistakes by logical reasoning.

    <center><h2 id="builtin">Built-ins</h2></center>

    Some predicates are already <i>predefined</i> when you start your
    Prolog&nbsp;system. These are
    called <i>built-in</i>&nbsp;predicates or
    simply&nbsp;<b>built-ins</b>.

    <br><br>

    For example, the built-in <tt>(=)/2</tt> is true <i>iff</i> its
    arguments <i>unify</i>. The built-in <tt>true/0</tt> is
    always <i>true</i>, and the built-in <tt>false/0</tt> is
    always <i>false</i>.

    <br><br>

    Many built-ins are only available for <i>convenience</i>, and you
    could easily define them yourself by the mechanisms explained
    above. For example, if they were not already defined, you could
    define the mentioned predicates as:

    <pre>
T = T.

true.

false :- a = b.
    </pre>

    However, not all built-ins can be defined in this way.

    <br><br>

    In addition to <tt>(=)/2</tt>, <tt>true/0</tt>
    and <tt>false/0</tt>, the most important built-ins you need to
    know to write useful and pure Prolog programs are:

    <ul>
      <li> <tt>dif/2</tt> is true <i>iff</i> its arguments are <i>different</i> terms</li>
      <li> <a href="clpz"><b>integer constraints</b></a> let you reason about arithmetic expressions</li>
      <li> <tt>(',')/2</tt> denotes <b>conjunction</b>: <tt>(A,B)</tt> is true <i>iff</i> both <tt>A</tt> <i>and</i> <tt>B</tt> are true</li>
      <li> <tt>(';')/2</tt> denotes <b>disjunction</b>: <tt>(A;B)</tt> is true <i>iff</i> either <tt>A</tt> <i>or</i> <tt>B</tt> <i>or</i> both are true.</li>
    </ul>


    <hr>
    <center><h2 id="collatz">Example: Collatz conjecture</h2></center>

    We illustrate all these concepts by means of an example:

    <blockquote>
      Take any positive integer <i>N</i>. To get the next integer,
      do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>If <i>N</i> is <i>even</i>, divide it by 2.</li>
        <li>If <i>N</i> is <i>odd</i>, multiply it by 3 and add 1,
          obtaining 3&times;<i>N</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Repeat this indefinitely to obtain the <i>hailstone
      sequence</i> <i>N</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>N</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>N</i><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;...

      <br><br>

      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz
          conjecture</a> is that the integer&nbsp;<b>1</b> appears in
      this sequence for <i>all</i> positive initial integers.
    </blockquote>

    We can model the hailstone sequence as follows, using the
    built-in <a href="clpz"><b>integer
    constraint</b></a>&nbsp;<tt>(#=)/2</tt> to denote <i>equality</i>
    of two integer&nbsp;expressions:

    <pre>
hailstone(N, N).
hailstone(N0, N) :-
        N0 #= 2*N1,
        hailstone(N1, N).
hailstone(N0, N) :-
        N0 #= 2*_ + 1,
        N1 #= 3*N0 + 1,
        hailstone(N1, N).
    </pre>

    The <b>predicate</b> <tt>hailstone/2</tt> is defined by
    three <b>clauses</b>: one <b>fact</b> and two <b>rules</b>. It
    defines a <b>relation</b> between two <b>arguments</b>. The first
    argument represents the current element of the sequence. The
    second argument is used to report solutions. After a <b>query</b>
    is posted and an <b>answer</b> is reported by the <b>toplevel</b>,
    the <i>alternatives</i> are tried on <b>backtracking</b>:

    <pre>
?- hailstone(3, N).
   N = 3
;  N = 10
;  N = 5
;  N = 16
;  N = 8
;  N = 4
;  N = 2
;  N = 1
;  N = 4
;  N = 2
;  N = 1
;  ...
    </pre>

    This <b>program</b> illustrates that a sequence of actions can be modeled
    as a relation between successive <i>states</i>.
    See <a href="/tist/"><i>Thinking in States</i></a> for more examples.

    <br><br>

    As is characteristic for pure relations, the predicate can be used
    in <i>all directions</i>. For example, we can post the <b>most
    general query</b>:

    <pre>
?- hailstone(X, Y).
   X = Y
;  clpz:(2*Y#=X)
;  clpz:(2*Y#=_A), clpz:(2*_A#=X)
;  clpz:(2*_A#=X), clpz:(2*Y#=_B), clpz:(2*_B#=_A)
;  ...
    </pre>

    When studying a Prolog predicate, try the most general query to see
    what answers look like <i>in&nbsp;general</i>.

    <br><br>

    We can implement <tt>hailstone/2</tt> more efficiently
    with&nbsp;<a href="metapredicates#if_3"><tt>if_/3</tt></a>.
