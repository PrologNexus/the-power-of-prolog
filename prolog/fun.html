    <center><h1>Fun Facts about Prolog</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    There is more to say about Prolog than can ever be&nbsp;said. At
    the same&nbsp;time, you also need to collect your own experiences
    with the language, and ponder certain aspects for&nbsp;yourself.
    Here are a few <i>true</i> facts about&nbsp;Prolog to help you
    begin your own observations and reflections.

    <center><h2>Tail recursion often arises naturally</h2></center>

    In Prolog, due to the power of <i>logic&nbsp;variables</i>, many
    predicates can be <i>naturally</i> written in a
    tail&nbsp;recursive way.

    <br><br>

    For example, consider
    again <a href="reading#list_list_together3"><tt>list_list_together/3</tt></a>:

    <pre>
list_list_together([], Bs, Bs).
list_list_together([A|As], Bs, [A|Cs]) :-
        list_list_together(As, Bs, Cs).
    </pre>

    It is easy to see that <tt>list_list_together(As, Bs, Cs)</tt> is
    a call in a&nbsp;<i>tail&nbsp;position</i>, because <i>no further
      goal follows</i>.

    Contrast this with a function like <tt>append</tt> in Lisp:

    <pre>
(defun append (x y)
  (if x
      (<b>cons</b> (car x) (append (cdr x) y))
    y))
    </pre>

    This version of <tt>append</tt> is <i>not</i> tail&nbsp;recursive
    in&nbsp;Lisp, because the recursive call is wrapped within a call
    of&nbsp;<tt>cons</tt> and thus <i>not</i> the final
    function&nbsp;call in this&nbsp;branch.

    <br><br>

    It is somewhat remarkable that such a basic function is <i>not</i>
    naturally tail&nbsp;recursive in&nbsp;Lisp, but the corresponding
    relation <i>is</i> tail recursive in&nbsp;Prolog!

    <br><br>

    In Prolog, many more predicates are <i>naturally</i> tail recursive.

    <center><h2>Tail recursion is sometimes inefficient</h2></center>


    In many cases, tail recursion is good for performance: When the
    predicate is <b>deterministic</b>, a tail call means that the
    Prolog system can automatically <i>reuse</i> the allocated space
    of the environment on the local&nbsp;stack. In typical cases, this
    measurably reduces memory consumption of your&nbsp;programs, from
    O(N) in the number of recursive&nbsp;calls to&nbsp;O(1). Since
    decreased memory consumption also reduces the stress on memory
    allocation and garbage&nbsp;collection, writing tail recursive
    predicates often improves both space and
    time <a href="efficiency">efficiency</a> of your
    Prolog&nbsp;programs.

    <br><br>

    However, take into account that many Prolog programs
    are <i>not</i>&nbsp;deterministic. As long as choice points
    remain, the current environment on the local stack <i>cannot be
    discarded</i>, because it may still be needed on backtracking.

    <br><br>

    For example, let us define the
    relation <tt>list_element_rest/3</tt> between
    a <a href="data#list">list</a>, one of its elements, and the
    list <i>without</i> that element:

    <pre>
list_element_rest([L|Ls], L, Ls).
list_element_rest([L|Ls0], E, [L|Ls]) :-
        list_element_rest(Ls0, E, Ls).
    </pre>

    <div style="border: 1px dotted; padding: 5pt">
      <a href="reading#declarative"><b>Declarative reading</b></a>:
      <ol>
        <li>The relation quite obviously holds for the
          list&nbsp;<tt>[L|Ls]</tt>, its
          <i>first</i> element&nbsp;<tt>L</tt>, and the remainder&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>.
        </li>
        
        <li><i>If</i> the relation holds for the
          list&nbsp;<tt>Ls0</tt>, one of its elements&nbsp;<i>E</i>,
          and the remainder&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>, <i>then</i> the relation
          also holds for <tt>[L|Ls0]</tt> and <tt>E</tt>, and the
          remainder&nbsp;<tt>[L|Ls]</tt>. This rule is
          clearly <i>tail&nbsp;recursive</i>, because the recursive
          call is its only&nbsp;goal.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    This predicate is quite versatile. Operationally, we can use it
    to <i>remove</i> one element from a list, to <i>add</i> an element
    to a&nbsp;list, and also in several other directions to either
    generate, complete or test possible&nbsp;solutions. For example:

    <pre>
?- list_element_rest("ab", E, Rest).
   E = a, Rest = "b"
;  E = b, Rest = "a"
;  false.
    </pre>

    And also:

    <pre>
?- list_element_rest(Ls, c, "ab").
   Ls = "cab"
;  Ls = "acb"
;  Ls = "abc"
;  false.
    </pre>


    In
    the <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/iso-prolog/prologue">Prologue
    for Prolog</a> draft and several Prolog systems, an almost
    identical predicate is available under the
    name&nbsp;<a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/iso-prolog/prologue#select"><tt>select/3</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    Using <tt>list_element_rest/3</tt> as a building block, we now
    define <tt>list_permutation1/2</tt> to describe the relation
    between a list and one of its <i>permutations</i>:

    <pre>
list_permutation1([], []).
list_permutation1(Ls, [E|Ps]) :-
        list_element_rest(Ls, E, Rs),
        <b>list_permutation1</b>(Rs, Ps).
    </pre>

    Note that that this predicate is <i>also</i> tail recursive.

    Here is an example query:

    <pre>
<b>?- list_permutation1("abc", Ps).</b>
   Ps = "abc"
;  Ps = "acb"
;  Ps = "bac"
;  Ps = "bca"
;  Ps = "cab"
;  Ps = "cba"
;  false.
    </pre>

    Let us now run a few benchmarks. We generate <i>all</i> solutions
    for lists of length 9, 10 and&nbsp;11:

    <pre>
?- L in 9..11, indomain(L), portray_clause(L),
   length(Ls, L),
   <b>time((list_permutation1(Ls,_),false))</b>.
<b>9.</b>
   % CPU time: 1.662s
<b>10.</b>
   % CPU time: 16.620s
<b>11.</b>
   % CPU time: 187.939s
    </pre>

    Now consider an alternative definition of this relation, which we
    call&nbsp;<tt>list_permutation2/2</tt>:

    <pre>
list_permutation2([], []).
list_permutation2([L|Ls0], Ps) :-
        <b>list_permutation2</b>(Ls0, Ls),
        list_element_rest(Ps, L, Ls).
    </pre>

    This version is <i>not</i> tail recursive. Let us run the same
    benchmarks with this new version:

    <pre>
?- L in 9..11, indomain(L), portray_clause(L),
   length(Ls, L),
   <b>time((list_permutation2(Ls,_),false))</b>.
<b>9.</b>
   % CPU time: 0.344s
<b>10.</b>
   % CPU time: 3.342s
<b>11.</b>
   % CPU time: 36.651s
    </pre>

    Note that this version is <i>several times faster</i> in each of
    the above cases! If you care a lot about performance, try to
    understand why this is&nbsp;so.

    <br><br>

    Together with the previous section, this example illustrates that
    tail recursion <i>does</i> have its uses, yet you should not
    overemphasize&nbsp;it. For beginners, it is more important to
    understand <a href="termination">termination</a>
    and <a href="nontermination">nontermination</a>, and to&nbsp;focus
    on clear declarative descriptions.

    <center><h2>Most cuts are red</h2></center>

    Almost every time you add a <tt>!/0</tt> to your program, it will
    be a so-called <i>red&nbsp;cut</i>. This means that it will make
    your program <i>wrong</i> in that it incorrectly omits some
    solutions only in <i>some</i> usage&nbsp;modes.

    <br><br>

    This is a tough truth to accept for most Prolog programmers. There
    always seems hope that we can somehow outsmart the system and get
    away with <i>green&nbsp;cuts</i>, which improve performance and
    honor all usage patterns. This hope is quite unfounded, because
    there typically are simply too many cases to consider, and you
    will almost invariably forget at least one of&nbsp;them.
    Especially if you are used to imperative programming, it is easy
    to fall into the trap of <i>ignoring general cases</i>.

    <br><br>

    For example, many beginners can correctly write a Prolog predicate
    that describes a&nbsp;<i>list</i>:

    <pre>
list([]).
list([_|Ls]) :-
        list(Ls).
    </pre>

    This is a very general relation that works in all directions. For example:

    <pre>    
?- list("abc").
   true.

?- list(Ls).
   Ls = []
;  Ls = [_A]
;  Ls = [_A,_B]
;  ... .

?- list(true).
   false.
    </pre>

    After seeing they can actually affect the control flow of Prolog
    with&nbsp;<tt>!/0</tt>, many beginners will <i>incorrectly</i>
    apply this construct in cases where it <i>cuts away solutions</i>.

    <br><br>

    For example, from a quick first glance, it may appear that the two
    clauses are <i>mutually&nbsp;exclusive</i>. After all, a list is
    <i>either</i> empty or has at least one element, right? And
    so <a href="horror"><i>the&nbsp;horror</i></a> begins when
    you&nbsp;write:

    <pre>
list([]) :- <b>!</b>. % <b>incorrect</b>!
list([_|Ls]) :-
        list(Ls).
    </pre>

    A quick test case "confirms" that <i>everything</i> still works:

    <pre>
?- list("abc").
   true.
    </pre>

    The <i>flaw</i> in this reasoning is that the clauses are in
    fact <i>not</i> mutually exclusive. They are only exclusive if the
    argument is <i>sufficiently instantiated</i>!

    <br><br>

    In Prolog, there are <i>more general cases</i> than you may be
    used&nbsp;to from other programming languages. For example, with
    the broken definition, we get:

    <pre>
?- list(Ls).
   Ls = []. % <b>incompleteness</b>!
    </pre>

    Thus, instead of an <i>infinite</i> set of solutions, the
    predicate now only describes a <i>single</i> solution!

    <br><br>

    To truly benefit from declarative programming, stay in
    the <a href="purity">pure</a>&nbsp;subset.
    Use <i>pattern&nbsp;matching</i> or meta-predicates
    like&nbsp;<tt><a href="metapredicates#if_3">if_/3</a></tt> to
    efficiently express logical alternatives while retaining full
    generality of your&nbsp;relations.

    <center><h2><tt>flatten/2</tt> is no relation</h2></center>

    In some introductory Prolog courses, you will be required to
    implement a predicate called&nbsp;<tt>flatten/2</tt>.

    <br><br>

    In such cases, consider the following query:

    <pre>
?- flatten(Xs, Ys).
    </pre>

    What is a valid answer in such situations? Suppose your predicate
    answers as follows:

    <pre>
Ys = [Xs].
    </pre>

    From a declarative point of view, this answer
    is&nbsp;<b>wrong</b>! The reason is that <tt>Xs</tt> may as well
    be a&nbsp;list, and in such cases, the result
    is <i>not&nbsp;flattened</i>! Witness the evidence for yourself:

    <pre>
?- flatten(Xs, Ys), Xs = "a".
   Xs = "a", Ys = ["a"].
    </pre>

    Thus, <tt>Y</tt> is <i>not</i> a flat&nbsp;list, but
    a <i>nested</i>&nbsp;list! In contrast, exchanging the goals yields:

    <pre>
?- Xs = "a", flatten(Xs, Ys).
   Xs = Ys, Ys = "a".
    </pre>

    This means that exchanging the order of goals <i>changes</i> the
    set of solutions.

    <br><br>

    Your instructor should be able to understand this fundamental
    declarative shortcoming if you point it&nbsp;out. In practice,
    use <tt>append/2</tt> to remove precisely one level
    of&nbsp;nesting in a sound&nbsp;way.


    <center><h2>Iterative deepening is often a good strategy</h2></center>

    Prolog's default search strategy is <i>incomplete</i>, and we can
    often easily make it <i>complete</i> by turning it
    into <i>iterative&nbsp;deepening</i>. This means that we search
    for solutions of depth&nbsp;0, then for those of depth&nbsp;1, then
    for those of depth&nbsp;2,&nbsp;etc.

    <br><br>

    From a quick first glance, this may seem very inefficient to you,
    because we are visiting the same solutions over and over, although
    we need each of them only&nbsp;<i>once</i>.

    <br><br>

    Now consider a search tree of depth&nbsp;<i>k</i>, with a
    branching factor of&nbsp;<i>b</i>. With iterative&nbsp;deepening
    up to and including depth&nbsp;<i>k</i>, we visit the <i>root</i>
    node <i>k+1</i>&nbsp;times, since we start at depth&nbsp;0, and
    revisit the root in each iteration, up to&nbsp;<i>k</i>. Further,
    we visit the <i>b</i>&nbsp;nodes at depth&nbsp;1
    exactly <span class="nobr"><i>k</i> times</span>. In general, we
    visit the <i>b</i><sup><i>j</i></sup>&nbsp;nodes at
    <span class="nobr">depth <i>j</i> (0&le;<i>j</i>&le;<i>k</i>)</span>
    exactly <span class="nobr"><i>k</i>+1&minus;<i>j</i> times</span>.

    <br><br>

    Let us now sum this up to calculate the total number of visits:
    <i>b</i><sup>0</sup>(<i>k</i>+1) + <i>b</i><sup>1</sup><i>k</i> +
    <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>k</i>&minus;1) + &hellip;
    +<i>b</i><sup><i>k</i></sup>.

    <br><br>

    Now the point: This sum is asymptotically <i>dominated</i>
    (<b>Exercise:</b>&nbsp;Why?) by the number of visits at the final
    depth&nbsp;<i>k</i>, where we visit
    <i>b</i><sup><i>k</i></sup>&nbsp;nodes, each
    exactly&nbsp;<i>once</i>. This shows that iterative deepening is
    in fact an asymptotically&nbsp;<i>optimal</i> search strategy
    under very general&nbsp;assumptions, because <i>every</i>
    uninformed search strategy must visit
    these <i>b</i><sup><i>k</i></sup>&nbsp;nodes at least&nbsp;once
    for completeness.

    <br><br>

    It also shows that people usually <i>underestimate</i> what
    exponential&nbsp;growth really&nbsp;means. If you find yourself in
    a situation where you really need to traverse such a
    search&nbsp;tree, iterative deepening is often a very good
    strategy, combining the memory efficiency of
    depth-first&nbsp;search with the <i>completeness</i> of
    breadth-first&nbsp;search. In addition, iterative deepening is
    easy to implement in Prolog via its built-in backtracking.
    <br><br>

    Note that iterative deepening requires <i>monotonicity</i>!
